"summarize: My daughter is 7 months old, and we started baby food right before 6 months. She has never been a fan of most green things (spring veggie mixes, green beans, etc) even though we keep trying them. But she likes this! It tastes more like pear sauce than anything (I tried it).<br /><br />It's also nicely portable. My little one is too young to squeeze it right into her mouth, but I can carefully squeeze some onto a spoon if we're out (if I'm home, I usually just squeeze it into a bowl). I also reseals well (the cap screws back on) and is easily tossed back into the diaper back if it's not finished. I would definitely buy this again and in other flavors.","portable, liked by a kid who doesn't like green things"
"summarize: I starter drinking Milo since I was two years old. It is the first energy drink for kids here in the Philippines. I recall enjoying drinking it even without milk or just eating it raw without hot or cold water when I was a toddler and can't help but love its taste even now that I am an adult.<br /><br />I was very happy to know that in Malaysia they have learned to mix it with Nescafe because it is also a habit of mine, and a few Filipinos. We call it the cheaper version of Starbucks coffee! :)<br /><br />Anyway, I drink my cup of Milo in the morning and before I sleep together with my Gene Eden Vir 101 supplements so I can keep those Chronic Viruses away from my body. The weather in the Philippines is so unpredictable I will need to boost my immune system to the highest level. I suggest you do the same with your body. Milo and Gene Eden combination is a cheap price in comparison to the health benefits it will provide to your body.",Liked It When I was a Kid; Enjoying it Now that I am an Adult
"summarize: Ingredients: Spices, salt, onion, paprika, garlic, dextrose, vegetable oil (partially hydrogenated soybean oil to help protect flavor), corn syrup solids, silicon dioxide (anticaking agent).<br /><br />Dad was the plant engineer at Stegner food products in Cincinnati, on a private drive they named ""Chili Hill"" so I think I can translate here. First and foremost you're buying their proprietary blend of spices, which they don't have to list individually, then salt (some really good spice blends I've tried advertise being salt free which makes them a better value, but this brand is a Cincinnati staple and including the salt is normal). Onion makes it unnecessary to chop one, paprika is a given in Cincinnati chili, I assume garlic also. Some Cincinnati chili recipes include chocolate by the way.<br /><br />Anyway after that dextrose is referred to as ""grape sugar"" on wikipedia, and the soybean oil has to be hydrogenated to be incorporated into a powdered mix. One packet will serve a family for dinner and contains:<br /><br />32g TOTAL grams of Carbs per packet, 8 grams of which is fiber and 8 grams of which is sugar.<br />4 TOTAL grams of fat, so no big deal on the hydrogenated oil unless you REALLY hate the stuff.<br />8 TOTAL grams of protein.<br /><br />So a little bit of ""grape sugar,"" naturally being a processed food a smidge of corn syrup sludge, and a tiny amount of silicon dioxide, which sounds a lot like some kind of sand-like molecule to me, not exactly appetizing but the last ingredient on the list and surely harmless.<br /><br />All you need to make the chili itself is 6oz of tomato paste and a pound of ground beef, and you don't even brown the ground beef, how easy is that? All in all considering how unhealthy the MSG and BPA in canned chilis and soups are, and the much higher price and limited availability of other Cincinnati Chili recipes, the convenience of this mix make it worth buying. As I understand it none of these ingredients can 'disguise' MSG (there are at least half a dozen ingredients that don't say MSG but can contain MSG).<br /><br />I made my first batch with two packets, 2lbs of beef, 2 cans of tomato paste, and a 1lb bag of pre-soaked Chana Dal beans, which have just about the lowest glycemic index of any carb source out there. It drew raves, but as much as like this mix for now if/when I get the time I'd like to look up recipes with chocolate in them, mix my own spices, chop an onion, mince the garlic, (stew a tomato? slaughter a cow?), and see how good the chili can get.",Here are the actual ingredients from the package...
"summarize: Cool idea for a product but the one I got is junk unless you don't mind a meat thermometer that jumps from 60 deg to 299 deg and back again within a few seconds and alarms every time it give an erroneously high reading, which is every few minutes.<br /><br />I purchased this product for my Father who has used it twice.  We tried all the tricks to get it to work, reset the transmitter and receiver, fresh batteries, moved the meat probe, etc.  Nothing worked.<br /><br />It has been more than 90 days since I ordered this product, so I called the Brookstone Limited Warranty Service at the 800 number listed in the manual.  A very nice but obviously frustrated gal tried for 25 minutes to find my order in the system but couldn't pull it off.  I asked her if she could just add me to the system since I obviously had a Brookstone product and a receipt from Amazon.  She said no, it doesn't work that way.  After speaking to her supervisor I was told I needed to contact Amazon for support.  Amazon said I had to contact the seller, TLC Stores.  I sent a email to TLC stores, well see what they say.<br /><br />As of this posting I have spent $65.98 for a product that doesn't work and over an hour and counting trying to get warranty service.<br /><br />For now I would say STAY AWAY FROM BROOKSTONE PRODUCTS!  My, albeit limited, experience has not been a positive one.<br /><br />If the situation is resolved I will update this posting and let everyone know the results of my quest for even marginally adequate customer service.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/27/11<br /><br />Brookstone will not warranty this item because I purchased it from TLC Store (amazon seller).  Brookstone only warranties their items to the ""original purchaser"".  Brookstone told me that by purchase this item from TLC Store ""you effective bought this item at a garage sale from the original purchaser so the warranty is null and void.""  I purchased this item thinking it was ""new"" with a warranty to back it up.  TLC Store has a 30 day warranty, or so I am told.  This effective took the 1 yr manufacture warranty and turned it into a 30 day warranty from some gal selling stuff from her garage.  I sent repeated emails but only received two replies neither of them came close to resolving the issue.<br /><br />Bottom line, this item is junk.  TLC Store has done nothing to help rectify the problem.<br /><br />2 LESSONS LEARNED<br />  1.  THIS BROOKSTONE PRODUCT IS JUNK AND THEY ARE UNWILLING TO BACKUP THEIR PRODUCTS.<br /><br />  2.  ANYONE CAN SET UP AN AMAZON STORE FRONT.  BUYER BEWARE, YOU MAY BE BUYING STUFF FROM SOMEONE'S GARAGE WHO<br />  IS JUST TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK AND DOESN'T CARE IF YOU GET SCREWED IN THE PROCESS.",JUNK!!!! Brookstone is not helping with warranty issues...
"summarize: Initially, the flavor is fairly accurate, however weak- from there, the flavor diminishes rapidly. I just timed it, and this gum goes flat within 5 minutes.<br />In light of my experience, I find these rave reviews somewhat... amusing; one reviewer even went as far as to describe it as ""incredibly tart"". Meh.<br />Like many new products in the realm of gum, pop, energy drinks, and fast food, they only need you to buy one. If everyone does that, they'll be sitting pretty.<br />Based on this experience, I have no desire to try the other flavors of Extra Dessert Delights.<br />Three stars = It's OK, but doesn't live up to the hype.",I really wanted to love this gum..
"summarize: Our cat, Isabel, has struggled with UTI and weight issues for years. After our vet recommended a wet food only diet, we experimented with a variety of brands (included Rx), but could never find a wet food that made Isabel feel full, and not spend the rest of the day begging us for more food.<br /><br />Then we tried Wellness canned food.<br /><br />Isabel loves it (but she loves anything that resembles food, so that's not a huge hurdle), but what is great about Wellness is it fills her up! And not only has she stopped constantly begging for food, she started to lose weight! Her dandruff is going away, she is no longer lethargic and has started to play again, and she generally seems like a happier cat.<br /><br />Now that her chronic UTI has finally cleared up, we give her mostly Wellness canned food with a little bit of dry food mixed in. This is still her primary source of food, and she is just as happy now as when we first made the switch.",Wellness canned food has been a lifesaver for our cat!
"summarize: I don't want to mince words. This stuff is awful.(Did not purchase at Amazon, rather at the local Unsafeway during a frantic holiday rush, when.. WHAT??? WE ARE OUT of truffle oil? People are coming over early! What are we going to do? Our local fave store was closed by then, so off I went...)<br />Anyway.<br />Trust me, you do not want to end up with over 16 oz of this stuff. (I only had 1 bottle to go through, and that took a while!) I didn't want to throw it out, but I didn't want to use it, so there it sat. Ugh. Never. Again.<br /><br />I am not pretending to be a ""golden nosed"" truffle expert. But I am savvy in the kitchen, and I can tell you what smells and tastes good, what adds to dishes, and what does not.<br /><br />Truffle oil is expensive, but necessary for pasta and risotto. But, like certain kinds of salt, or olive oil, or vinegar, it is a ""finishing"" product, one that should be added at the very end for that final flavor spike, just before plating.<br /><br />My advice would be to buy a higher quality product, and use it sparingly- with truffle oil, a little goes a long way. (But with this product, the flavor was weak and flat- I couldn't get that heady 'truffle punch"", as I call it, no matter how much I wasted.)<br /><br />I recommend S. Tartufi truffle oil, but I am open to recommendations, should anyone reading this be especially in love with theirs.<br />Lemme know! Thanks, and I hope this helped.","Yuck! Save your money, and buy something else!"
"summarize: I don't remember when Callard & Bowser toffees disappeared from the candy & gum displays at my local stores. But I remember being addicted to those chocolate toffees wrapped in wax paper and stacked in a roll. Some form of nostalgia got me searching for them, and somehow I was directed to try Walkers Traditional Chocolate Toffees.<br /><br />If you like the taste of chocolate and enjoy a chewy candy, these are simply perfect. Seemingly impervious to weather, sweet and rich, you don't need to eat a ton of them to feel like you have had a satisfying little treat. The ones I tried came in a bag of maybe a dozen or so (I didn't count; sorry) and went a little too fast. I'll definitely be re-ordering them to have as a little gift to myself.",Miss Callard & Bowser? Not Any More!
"summarize: So I noticed the gripes in others' reviews about there not being enough of certain flavors, and the response from the company about working on a fix, so I thought I'd go through and count the tub I received today to see how they were coming along.<br /><br />Before I get to that, though, I should note that the tub was significantly cracked when I received it today, and there were a few loose and smashed suckers inside - but not a ton, and no more than can be expected of this sort of thing.  Also, by the time I was done with the tally below, any irritation I might have felt was completely gone because there were extra suckers anyway, and more than enough to make up for the ones that were in pieces and loose.<br /><br />Of the six flavors, here's how many I had of each:<br /><br />WET-FACE WATERMELON = 18<br />TOOBERRY BLUEBERRY = 17<br />SOUR APPLE TART = 22<br />POMEGRANATE PUCKER = 16<br />MANGO TANGO = 25<br />STRAWBERRY SMASH = 16<br />VERY VERY CHERRY = 20<br />GOOGLY GRAPE = 21<br /><br />As you can see, they're pretty even, or about the same distribution you'd expect in a bag of Skittles or M&Ms.  Certainly, plenty of each!  I haven't tasted them all (it's late and I have to go to bed), but I did eat all of the little pieces at the bottom, because I'm greedy like that, and they were all very good! :)<br /><br />I should also mention that I sent these several months ago to a sick friend in another state without having had them myself, first, but she absolutely loved them and gives them to her students in class when they're especially good (which is rare, because they're in college).<br /><br />Hope this review helped!","Very tasty, pretty even distribution of flavors"
"summarize: The sweetener is Evaporated Cane Juice, which I think is a fancy way of saying ""sugar"" (from sugar cane).<br /><br />But they aren't too sweet.  The hint of peanut butter is just right.<br /><br />3/4 cup seems like an very small amount, and it has 110 calories (16 from fat), 2g fat, .5 saturated, 230 mg Sodium, 105 mg Potassium, 23g carbs, 2g fiber, 6g sugar, 3g protein, 2% A, 2% Calcium, 6% Irion.<br /><br />I mix them with 8g of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00013YYKS"">Yerba Prima Psyllium Whole Husks</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X0NZ60"">Barbara's Bakery Shredded Spoonfuls Multigrain,</a> and then pour sugar free almond milk (organic whole foods brand), or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006OIXJQO"">So Delicious Vanilla Sugar Free Coconut Milk</a> over the mixture.<br /><br />The So Delicious Sugar Free Vanilla coconut milk actually has stevia in it, which makes that combination a very sweet experience.",Get my captain crunch fix on
"summarize: I love this onion mix and am so glad to be able to buy it with Subscribe & Save. This has become a staple in our house and has more uses than you can shake a wooden spoon at: mashed potatoes, soups, scrambled eggs & omelets, salad dressings, dips, marinated mushrooms, sauteed anything...<br /><br />Also, if you are a fan of a certain famous cream cheese in the Chive and Onion flavor... this spice mix is your ticket to making your own version at home...for much less money. I've even made it with yogurt cheese, which is a bit healthier and also yummy.<br /><br />The flavor is surprising for a freeze dried spice and ridiculously versatile. LOVE!",Easy way to add flavor to many things
"summarize: We try to eat only whole grains and so have tried a lot of whole wheat pastas.  We used to eat Arrowhead Mills 100% whole wheat spaghetti and it was okay, not anything we'd eat a whole 12 inch plate of.  Then our local grocery store started carrying Full Circle 100% whole wheat Capellini and we thought that was the cat's meow.  Then we tried the Gia Russa 100% whole wheat angel hair and were hooked.  It is the best 100% whole wheat pasta we've tried.  I will say that it appears that when talking about 100% whole wheat pasta that the thinner the pasta the better tasting.  So maybe that's all it is with this product, that of the 100% whole wheat pastas we've tried (including other shapes like penne, rotini, jumbo shells, and so forth) that this was the best because it was the thinnest.  In any case, we can eat a whole 12 inch plate of it plain and in my husband's case he'll even have seconds, that's how good it is.",Best tasting 100% whole wheat pasta we've tried
"summarize: I saw this at my local grocery store and decided to give it a try. I like baking, and though I've baked brownies from scratch, I've not had the best results - some turn out too hard, some turn out dry, and the other brand mixes had not yielded great results either.<br /><br />Well, Ghirardelli has truly outdone itself. This mix turned out a great batch of brownies, earning high praise from my husband and daughter, and it was so easy! The brownies have chocolate bits in them which add to the already rich chocolate flavor, and they are deliciously chewy and moist, even after I stored them in the refrigerator for a couple of days. I also tried out the Ghirardelli brownie mix with walnuts and they were great too. I'm sticking to this brand to satisfy my family's brownie craving from now on!","Chewy, rich milk chocolate taste, and moist!"
"summarize: Make no mistake this is not a substitute for sleep.  If you are tired from lack of sleep then this most likely will not work too well (it can't cure exhaustion.)  However, if you are having one of those days or just your usual afternoon crash this serves as a well needed ""kick in the rear"" so to speak.  I don't feel like I have just went and slept 8 hours but I do feel awake and like I am able to make it longer than a few seconds without falling asleep if I sit down.  I say if you are on the fence go to the store and buy a single dose first to see if you like it.  I recommend it.","Gives me that mutch needed ""kick in the rear"" when I am feeling drowsy"
"summarize: I recently purchased my first Keurig machine, the B60 model (which is wonderful, by the way), and my machine was one of those ""bonus packages"" that came with a small variety sampler pack (12 k-cups). Having gone through most of this fantastic assortment already, I decided to order a variety assortment from Amazon. I read all the reviews -- positive and negative -- and decided to take a chance on this one. It arrived today, and although there are some neat flavors that I am anxious to try, there is VERY LITTLE variety. I ordered the 24-count sampler. Out of these, 4 k-cups are truly unique/limited edition flavors that are not Green Mountain. That leaves 20 k-cups of Green Mountain that either French Vanilla (the majority), Caramel Vanilla Cream, Blueberry or Hazelnut. Luckily, these are at least flavors I like, they are just not all that unique. Probably won't order from these folks again, due to the lack of variety. I was really hoping for more choices, like the one that came with my Keurig (the sampler pack had 12 different coffees from all different coffee companies, some I hadn't heard of and were quite good). I hate to whine, but my morning cup is a very important part of my day! Too bad... if you like French Vanilla with a few surprises thrown in, then this assortment is for you, but not if you are looking for a true variety.","I hate to say ""Me, too"", but..."
summarize: The best thing about jelly bellies is that they seem to be using higher quality ingredients than other American manufacturers but I remember when jelly beans didn't have to be gourmet to taste good.  I bought a 7 oz. bag of 30 flavors from Target and I find that bag to be too much for me but I would have bought the full 50 flavor assortment if Target had sold it because of the organization and identification of flavors.  I wasn't supposed to get cantaloup in my 30 flavor bag but I did get one and that flavor was so much better than tangerine.  I also liked the root beer.  The popcorn flavor was interestingly reminiscent of artificially fragrant movie theatre popcorn.  The jelly belly flavors are interesting but I prefer the lightly flavored pastel jelly beans available during Easter.  I believe they are manufacturered by Brachs.  They are gentler tasting than jelly bellies.,Jelly Bellies don't knock my socks off
"summarize: Some of the other reviewers noted that they still had reactions to this product.  Look at the ingredients - any sort of hydrolyzed vegetable protein contains MSG.  This is a trick used by most companies in the food industry.  There are like 25 different names for MSG- or free glutamate-containing substances, and they just hide it under a different name  (Google ""Other Names for MSG"" and you will be appalled).  Unfortunately the FDA does not require any real disclosure on labels - MSG can also be labeled simply as ""spices"" or ""natural flavors.""  It's safe to go ahead and assume that any flavor base seasoning such as that used here will have some type of MSG in it.  If another processed product such as flavor base is used in creating a new product, the ingredients in the component product (e.g., flavor base)are not required to be disclosed on the label. At least this manufacturer had the decency to list what was in the flavor base.",BEWARE!  THIS STILL HAS MSG IN IT!
"summarize: My family and I absolutely LOVE this slow cooker chicken! and every time I've made it for company, they too have loved it. I usually make it over egg noodles. I have been looking for this particular seasoning packet in every store I can think of, since we returned to the states 3 years ago, but haven't been able to find it ANYWHERE... So, one day I got curious, and searched online and found it here. I wish I could buy it by individual packs, rather than the case... as it will probably take me 2 years to use all 12 packages (assuming they don't expire before then), but alas the taste is worth it! McCormick really should sell this at more stores. So far I have only found it in Texas (about 6 years ago), and in military commissaries overseas (4 yrs ago).",excellent meal! so why can't i find it in stores anymore???
"summarize: From the start let me say that I enjoy crunchy and nutty foods, the more so the better. I am lucky I haven't broken a tooth based on some of the things I like to eat.<br /><br />I am a big fan of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034EDLS2"">KIND Fruit & Nut, Fruit & Nut Delight, All Natural, Gluten Free Bars)</a>(there are many of them, I've linked to just one.) I thought I'd give this cereal a try and it's just as good as their other products. It's very chewy, naturally sweet and has flax to boot - which is something I usually put in my cereals anyway. Just delicious.<br /><br />Highly recommended.",Super crunchy and tasty - if you're a fan of their bars you'll love this
"summarize: Let me start this review by saying that I ***LOVE*** my Keurig machine! I can get a great cup of coffee, any strength, any brew, any boldness, any flavor, without brewing up a whole pot. It is a brilliant concept for coffee, which has always lent itself to either mass-brewing or pathetic ""instant-coffee"".<br /><br />Tea and cocoa, however, typically cost anywhere from $1-$4 per box of 20-30 bags/packets. Tea and cocoa are inherantly single-shot items to begin with, so the idea of paying $10-14 for a box of 24 tea or cocoa K-cups is ludicrous. It offers no real extra convenience and costs about ten times the price. It would be like buying a Kia Rio for $8,000 or a Daewoo Leganza for $80,000... they are both basically the same car, so why pay ten times more for one? It just makes no sense.<br /><br />On a side note, I also have found that this cocoa is a bit watery at times and doesn't even hold up to a packet of Swiss Miss and some hot water.",10x the cost of Swiss Miss packets for an inferior product and no real convenience factor!
"summarize: I have been drinking really good Irish Breakfast tea for the past ten years and when my provider was backordered, I decided to give this tea a try since Irish Breakfast has to be Irish Breakfast right? Found out that this is not true with this tea. The tea comes well packaged and is very much a whole leaf tea but when I took a smell I smelled something that suggested it was tea. I immediately became worried and made a cup the next morning and soon discovered how bad the tea was. The tea has the orange color of Irish Breakfast but there is scarcely any aroma or flavor. The tea was very weak and it doesn't get any better by adding more leaves. I liked the idea of a subscription for tea but this one loses my vote.",This is not Irish Breakfast Tea
"summarize: Just The Cheese Barbeque flavor are just about right to my taste: a little too salty, not extraordinarily cheesy, with just a tang of BBQ flavoring. Maybe I have a weird palate, but I'm not hating these snacks like most reviewers do.<br /><br />So why only two stars? For one, JTC brand is hardly ""just the cheese."" Pull up a chair while I recall the ingredients (other than the cheese) in the Barbeque flavor: powdered cellulose, salt, tomato, torula yeast, spices, dehydrated garlic and onion, natural smoke flavor, paprika, sodium diacetate, inosinate and guanylate, sucralose, and silicon dioxide. Got all that?<br /><br />Two, JTC brand proudly boasts ""1 g carbohydrate per serving."" Perfect, in other words, for low-carb diets. If you look at the back of the Herb & Garlic flavor, one serving is about 18 pieces, 150 calories, and contains 10 grams protein. So a bag contains two servings. All well and good. Until you get to the Barbeque flavor, where one serving is 9 pieces, 75 calories, and contains 5 grams protein. So the Barbeque bag, which contains the same 2 oz. as the Herb & Onion flavor, has twice as many servings! In other words, JTC brand has toyed with the serving size so they can boast 1 g carbohydrate per serving. Unless you're on an ultra-low carb diet, those few extra carbs won't matter much. But manipulating the serving size to get that crucial ""1 g carbohydrate per serving"" is dishonest in my book.<br /><br />And finally, JTC brand is too expensive for what you get. I know that cheese isn't cheap, and that JTC brand is a smaller company not affiliated with any of the big names like Nabisco. But a little over two dollars is a bit much for a small bag, even if the texture does relieve a chips craving.","Ok taste, but misleading nutritional info and pricey"
"summarize: I keep getting these because my puppy likes them and they are safe for her to chew.  They don't break off into pieces that can hurt her.  I have a ""Premier Busy Buddy Bristle Bone"" that unscrews on both ends.  You just slip these on and give it to them and it will keep them busy for a long time.  I have the small size, but they have larger ones for bigger dogs.  They also have one that has a sort of ball in the middle that these little round chews slip onto also.  It's a pretty good product and I'll keep getting them until she gets tired of them.",My puppy likes these a lot
"summarize: I first bought this reluctantly out of dire need and was really surprised at how good it is. I've bought many, many bottles of very expensive white truffle oils in glass and and have returned several completely dead ones over the years. While I generally favor products in glass, the truffle aroma is an incredibly volatile (anyone who has left a bottle of truffle oil in a cupboard for a few months has probably noticed most of the aroma has dissipated) one and possibly labile under exposure to light. In any case, I've never had a dead bottle of this brand. Also, I have for years stored my truffle oil in the fridge; great to preserve the aroma but, if the carrier oil is olive, this poses a big problem of convenience as olive oil will harden under refrigeration.<br /><br />The big benefit of La Tourangelle is in fact the safflower carrier oil a it does not harden at refrigerator temperature or, if it does, it does so over weeks or months and I usually reach for mine every few days. Also, I just think it silly to bash this stuff for the neutral character of its carrier oil as I'm using truffle oil for truffle aroma. If I want really good EVOO character I'd rather choose the oil myself rather than leave that decision up to the truffle oil producer (and what is the likelihood that someone who doesn't specialize in olive oil is going to use the best one).<br /><br />Ignore the misinformed food snobs. Buy this, use it, store it in the fridge between uses.",Sound product and a great buy
"summarize: Over the years I've randomly picked up various sea salts hoping to find that perfect salt crystal that almost looks like it formed into tiny little delicate flakes. After running through quite a few, salt shakers, salt grinders, natural sea salts, salts harvested by natives who have been doing it for hundreds of years, you name it! They all seem to come up the same for me, the texture is never right. Even salt grinders can't get that perfect texture. So to make a long story short, I picked a shaker of this stuff up in the health food store one day and haven't looked back since. I've found my perfect salt! The texture is flawless; flakey and just slightly clumpy without over doing it. About the only thing I can say that's negative is the shaker dispensers tend to clump at the top and it takes an occasional reverse tap to clear the holes. Not a big deal though.<br /><br />I do wish you could buy one bag of this stuff instead of 6! The salt shakers are 7.5 ounces and last me forever. These bags are 35.3 ounces and there's 6 of them! If you have extended family then I suggest you give a  bag to each family member and save one for yourself. Otherwise don't hesitate to get this stuff, I love it!",Best Sea Salt I've Ever Used!
"summarize: I came across this sauce about five years ago. A Thai friend had brought it over and claimed it was one of the hottest things he's ever tried.. I told him that being a Latino guy, I was used to dealing with hot stuff, (Habaneros being my favorite because of bite and taste)I followed his advise and used a toothpick to put a tiny dot on a chicken wing... and it did the job well!! I came across this sauce again at a Ross store and bought a couple (which by the way, lasted for a long, long time).I was very impressed with how hot this sauce was that I went out of my way to put little DOT ""Hazardous Material"" and ""Flammable Liquid"" placards on it... specially after I found my roomate bent over the sink, making hissing sounds and practically scrubbing his tongue in an attempt to stop the burn, he had treated this sauce and if it was your common Taco Bell sauce... big mistake. Unless you like scratching bathroom walls, treat this sauce with respect! For beginners (or anyone without ""hot sauce scar tissue"") use a toothpick to test your limits and move up little by litte. It's not meant to add flavor to your food but to add bite to it. Try a small drop in your ranch sauce, you'll love it! try a drop in anything in the pot, from pastas to stews to chili, (be careful with soups, the heat multiplies). I now have about 2 oz. left in my bottle and have been scanning the shelves at Ross, hoping to find a bottle for under $3 but so far, it looks like I might have to place and order online..",Great sauce!! but treat it with respect..

"summarize: I love coconut water and have tried most varieties at my local grocery stores. I was excited to try this new variety.<br /><br />It comes in a tall can. I don't mind this although I prefer glass so I can put the lid back on and save it for later. On the other hand, it encourages me to stay extra hydrated because I don't want to waste any, so I go ahead and drink it all. Also, there has been recent news questioning BPA inside the lining of many canned food items. This can does not say whether or not it is BPA free.<br /><br />The can does state gluten-free, vegan, and non-GMO. I don't know differences in the production of coconut water, so I cannot comment on the sustainability of this company. In terms of taste quality though, it's as good as my favorites. A distinguishing characteristic for me is a distinctable nutty finish on your tongue. Not strong in any way, just light and sweet enough to make you crave another drink. This one definitely has it!<br /><br />Only thing missing for me was the pulp!",yummy nutty flavor - excellent drink!
"summarize: We've been giving our Brittany Costco brand heavy meat dog food. He doesn't particularly like it, but the first ingredient is lamb, and he certainly eats it. I thought I'd try this stuff instead, and I'm shocked- he digs in like crazy. I can barely keep him from the bowl after I put it in. On taste, it must be a home run.<br /><br />It loses a star, however, due to the first ingredient, corn. Oh, and the third ingredient, corn. And the fourth, flour. Dogs aren't omnivores, and I've yet to see one farm any corn, let alone domesticate a crop and turn it into a staple grain, plus harvest it, blah blah. Dogs aren't meant to eat that much corn. I'll spend the extra for real meat, and keep searching until I find a brand he loves to eat.","Dog loves it, but are they the right ingredients?"
"summarize: Our now 11 month old son eats these. We usually make our own food and freeze it, but sometimes we're on the run and don't have the ability to store frozen food, so something like this is a blessing. It smells and tastes pretty good to an adult palate, and the little guy eats them up.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Shelf stable so it can slip in the diaper bag for a long time<br />- Won't leak, break, or mess up - and the cap is tough enough to get off that it won't slip<br />- He actually eats it<br />- Organic<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It's a bit thin. We usually bring some cereal along to thicken it up and he loves it. For a smaller baby, I'm sure the thinness would work well.","Loves it. A bit thin, though."
"summarize: I sent these to my mother for an early Mother's Day gift.  I placed the order on late Friday, and it arrived on Monday!  My mother called me to say that the flowers were absolutely gorgeous (and she is a flower ""savant""....she grows them and knows them), fresh, vibrantly colorful, and perfect. Each flower stem was in a vial of water, and was totally fresh and lovely. She was absolutely delighted with my gift. I can only say, thank you, Amazon, and thank you to the seller of these Dendrobium Orchids, who wisely marketed them through Amazon.  I doubt I would have stumbled across them otherwise! I would recommend these to anyone who wants to give a gift of flowers.  The price was reasonable, and the results impeccable!","Exquisite, vibrantly colorful, totally fresh, and a fast delivery!"
"summarize: The sugar is excellent. It is just a touch more brown than pure-white sugar, and the texture is a little on the coarse side (the grains are a bit larger). However, the sugar still dissolves and mixes just as well as regular sugar when baking or sweetening my coffee. Honestly cannot complain about the product itself.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, the box comes with 12 small 1 lb. bags. This is quite surprising as I've seen other retailers selling a 4 lb. version (so aside from real bulk orders (>25 lbs) a larger size does exist). Nevertheless, when it comes to price, Amazon.com still seems to do just fine, in my opinion. I've never seen a grocery store carry a 1 lb. bag of this sugar for less than $4 (and you'd be lucky to even find it at that price). Obviously, with Subscribe and Save, you're getting a bag for about $2.50. Outlets that I've seen carrying the 4 lb. version are usually selling those anywhere from $8 to $9 each. So yes, Amazon.com could be doing a touch better, and when it comes to selling 12 tiny bags of sugar as opposed to 3 decently sized bags, obviously Amazon.com has some work to do.",Excellent sugar at a good price (although could be more affordable)
"summarize: Being unable to find canned pumpkin in any of my local stores, I held my breath (after reading the mixed reviews and mentions of damaged cans), took a chance and ordered a 12 pack.  Of the 12 cans, only 2 arrived undamaged.  Another 2 had small dents, which shouldn't affect the product or make opening the cans a problem.  Unfortunately, the 8 remaining cans are too badly dented to use.  Dents deep enough to have bent the cans sideways, and in the case of top dents, probably make it difficult/impossible to fully open with can opener. These will be discarded. Since some of the cans are dented on the top while others on the bottom, and the two undented cans were on an OUTSIDE row and the most severely dented on the INSIDE row, it appears that the cans were dented prior to packaging and not damaged in shipping.<br /><br />It is disappointing to see that damaged product is still a problem so many months after the first reviews called attention to the issue but an Amazon customer service rep. promised that someone would look into the issue to try to ascertain just where the damage is happening.  I haven't actually tried the pumpkin in the any of the 4 'safe' cans yet, so my review isn't based on the actual quality of the pumpkin but given the outrageously bad condition of the packaging there's no way I could rate this higher.",8 of 12 Cans Very Badly Damaged (Dents)
"summarize: A friend told me about this product. She is very health-conscious when it comes to food for her kids. One of her kids has allergy, so she has also been looking for good gluten free food products. She first found this line of soup base in a high-end food store in the East Coast and tried it out. Her whole family loved (and still loves) it. She sent me one as gift a few months ago and we tried it out and my kids love it too. We used to boil meat and vegetable or 2-3 hours and used the soup to cook food for the kids. This was very time and energy consuming. We tried other soup bases in the past but the kids complained about being very thirsty after drinking those. This one is great. It saves us a lot of work and the kids still get healthy delicious soup! I recently found it on Amazon & bought 5 different flavors. The order arrived within 2 days with my Amazon Prime membership and we now can enjoy the different flavors.",Excellent healthy delicious organic soup base! Great for kids!
"summarize: I like this drink, and it's effective for flavoring the iffy water that often emerges from drinking fountains and such. I've bought several more vials since trying this one, and have been carrying it regularly in my purse. I like it a bit stronger than the label suggests, which means it doesn't make quite as many servings as expected, but it's still far cheaper than buying a bottle of anything when you want a flavored beverage. I also like it better than the packets I'd tried before, because it won't accidentally rip open in my purse. (I do still use the packets at work on occasion, where they can stay safely in my desk drawer.)<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this product, and even this specific flavor.","Nice, and fits in my purse without breaking open"
summarize: I bought this pasta because as a diabetic I am interested on lower my glycemic index and I really enjoy eating pasta.  It tastes great- no real difference in flavor from regular pasta- cooks in the same amount of time and the pasta water is great for thickening the sauce.<br /><br /> My only negative comment is the order I received has a few small beetles in it- I froze all the pasta to kill them but still occasionally find one floating in the pasta water that I have to pluck out.  Apparently pasta is a common way for them to enter the house as pasta is never heated when it is made- just dried/cut and boxed.,great pasta but came with pantry bugs
"summarize: I didn't realize Cheez-It had so many different flavors. I think it can be a slippery slope. For example, Doritos makes a bunch of flavors, but none are quite as good as two of their oldest flavors: Cool Ranch and Nacho Cheese. The other flavors are usually pretty good, but I tend to stop liking them as much before the bag is empty. What about the Mozzarella Cheez-Its? How do they stack up?<br /><br />Rather than just give you my impressions of the Mozzarella Cheez-It, I decided to share these with some coworkers. Here are the taste test results.<br /><br />Tester 1, Female, 60s: ""Mmmmmm,"" she said after the first couple crackers. The words ""good"" and ""tasty"" came up and she remarked they have a totally different taste than the original Cheez-Its.<br /><br />Tester 2, Female, 30s: She got a funny look on her face and said, ""Weird...I'm not sure...Not bad...Not as good as the original Cheez-Its."" After a few more crackers she somewhat changed her tune and said they were quite tasty.<br /><br />Tester 3, Female, 40s: She didn't love them but thought they were ""all right."" She also preferred the original Cheez-It over the Mozzarella Cheez-Its.<br /><br />Tester 4, Female, 40s: She ate one carefully and started nodding. After a few more she commented that she preferred the Mozzarella over the original flavor. She liked the flavor a lot and said she'd definitely buy them.<br /><br />Tester 5, Female, 40s: She liked the smell of the crackers and also commented, ""Mmmmmm,"" while raising her eyebrows. She liked the ""buttery"" flavor and commented she liked them better than the original Cheez-Its. She also eyed the nutritional information and approved of the zero sugars.<br /><br />Tester 6, Male, 50s: He enjoyed the ""very nice mozzarella taste,"" and the ""nice light flavor."" He commented that he could eat ""a lot more of these"" and that he'd definitely buy them.<br /><br />Me, Male, 30s: I liked their aroma a lot. The box says ""creamy and mild"" and I'd agree. The first cracker's flavor really coated my palate like a sharp cheddar would but without that overpowering, strong taste. The texture of the cracker was enjoyable, too: very crisp. Also, the mild flavor of the Mozzarella Cheez-Its doesn't leave you with stank breath. I think they're on par with the original flavor Cheez-It which is not my favorite cracker snack, but I do eat them from time to time.<br /><br />Eating contest: Tester 2 and I had a contest to see who could fit more whole Cheez-Its in their mouth at once. Tester 2 fit 15 and I fit 22.  I bring this up because a serving size is 1 ounce or 25 crackers (150 calories, 7g of fat, 180mg sodium, 19g carbs). That should give you a visual of how large a serving size is.<br /><br />These crackers are a winner. They have a good flavor that isn't overpowering but also won't get boring. Some testers thought they'd be great in a party mix with other Cheez-It flavors.<br /><br />I received this box of crackers at no cost as a member of the Vine Program.",Good flavor in this tasty treat
"summarize: I would just like to say that this frisbee has always been my favorite and my dog max's as well(when you first get it you should wet it down with water because it's a little light)but after a little time it will break in and fly perfect, you just need to know what direction the wind is blowing when playing with it(these will normally last my german shepherd four-six months,using it one hour per day every day)with an aggressive playing dog.This is not a chew toy,it's used for excersising(so to all the people that let their dogs chew it,wrestle with it and use it for hanging from in the air)don't complain about how long it lasts(just complain about the lack of common sense your using playing with it)If you have a less aggressive dog this frisbee will last a very long time and please your dog every time you play.If you expect more from this product you'll have to take care of it.cleaning it with water,keeping it away from the dog untill play time(so they don't chew it to bits)just use common sense so you and your dog can have fun and enjoy it.Final thought,even if this frisbee starts to show age and have a couple of holes here and there you can always get a needle and thread to repair the damage and save on buying another one.I bought three of these from (little family members) for like $12.50 each, they not only arrived on time but those guys provided a five star service.when I need more of these frisbees in the future I will not hesitate to buy again from both the seller(little family members or the product booda).",same ole frisbee same ole quality
summarize: Our Golden Retriever used Innova Large Breed puppy food for a year.  We switched to this over a course of a few weeks without any issues.<br /><br />She is healthy with a nice coat being on this for 3 months.  She maintains her weight well on Innova and seems to be full whenever she gobbles down the bowl.  I agree with the reviewer who stated this is the least expensive of the best dog foods in pricing other higher end foods.<br /><br />We buy locally for $60 a bag and it seems to last awhile since its a higher quality nutrient dense food (I can update an exact time in the future).  You can spend less on a bag of food with fillers...and you probably will go through it quicker.<br /><br />It is worth the extra $$ in a healthier pet/member of our family.,Bang for you buck best deal in the better dog foods
"summarize: I can't say enough about ZiwiPeak, hands down the best dog food on the market, both dry (11 lbs) and canned food. I have been buying them regularly and Whole Health Pet had the best price, special offers, shipping and service. Unfortunately, with the New Zealand manufacturer's new canning supplier and packaging, within two weeks Whole Health Pet started charging freight and their prices jumped up to $2.00 more average PER CAN (plus shipping), and $40 more PER BAG (plus shipping)!! I am not changing ZiwiPeak for my dogs, but I am buying elsewhere which has slightly lower price overall but with faster shipping. I feel I need to talk about the price, because while ZiwiPeak could be the best dog food ever, so many more dogs cannot have them because the price is simply beyond their owners' reach, not good.<br /><br />I hope Amazon Prime will pick up this line soon!!!","greatest dog food ever, but the price jump the worst"
"summarize: I too ordered two boxes of Brooklyn K-cups - decaf in my case.  Grounds were everywhere inside the Keurig holder, and the Keurig no longer made coffee since the little hole was clogged.  We blamed the coffee maker and cleaned it out.  It worked fine until we tried another Booklyn decaf k-cup.  Again grounds were all over the holder, the k-cup was full of water, and the coffee maker was clogged.  There is something seriously wrong with the packaging of Brooklyn k-cups.  I see Amazon won't take them back so I may try to open them all and use them in our drip coffee maker.",Brooklyn Decaf Cups spread grounds all over
"summarize: MIO's concept is quite cool. Basically, these are small 1.6-ouce squirt bottles which you can store pretty much anywhere - a cabinet, a desk drawer, a backpack, etc. - and you squirt them into water to create a  flavored drink. In this case, it's ""peach tea"" flavored and you put in one squirt for every 8 ounces of water. It's extremely convenient to just grab a bottle of water, throw two squirts of this stuff in, shake it up, and enjoy.<br /><br />But more importantly, does it taste good? Well... it taste OK. Nobody would mistake it for fresh Peach Tea, but it is somewhat palatable. I didn't notice the ""chemical"" aftertaste that other reviewers have mentioned, but it definitely does come across as artificially flavored. Based on other reviewers comments, it seems like there is wide range of opinions on the taste (as you would probably expect). So if you're looking for a convenient way to have flavored water anytime, then it's probably worth at least trying this product.","Cool concept with an ""OK"" taste"
"summarize: Cheerios is a staple and a comfort food to all of us who grew up eating breakfast sitting in front of the TV while watching Ray Raynor. Or whatever classic children's programming they showed outside Chicago.<br /><br />Although you could always doctor up your bowl with sliced fruit, Apple Cheerios was a welcome addition to the General Mills product line. But sometimes it's better to quit while you're ahead.<br /><br />Now we have--Banana Nut Cheerios! This is not a good breakfast choice. For one thing, banana is really hard to artificially reproduce. I don't know why. But companies keep trying, and it's almost always a disaster. Things that taste like authentic bananas, ie, banana bread, use authentic bananas. I don't know who was involved in the marketing focus group for Banana Nut Cheerios, but maybe they were all having sinus issues that day and couldn't taste a thing.<br /><br />Banana Nut Cheerio tastes strongly of FAKE banana, which is worse than when a real banana gets all black on the outside and mushy on the inside. I couldn't taste the ""nut"" element because the fake banana was so overwhelming. And it was pervasive. It took forever for the aftertaste to go away.<br /><br />Even my dogs rejected a little Cheerio ""treat"" when we came in from our walk.<br /><br />No one in the family would eat more than one serving, so eventually we threw the nearly-full box away. It was funny because one of my co-workers told the EXACT same story about the Banana Nut Cheerios she bought for her family.<br /><br />So if you have little kids that have weird tastes  (and remember that some kids will even eat asphalt and laundry detergent, although I think that's a mineral deficiency) this might be okay. But for everyone else, stick with the original, or the apple flavor.<br /><br />At least, for your dog's sake.",Didn't Go Bananas Over the Flavor
"summarize: I hate to be the only dissenter here but these are not the kind we used to buy in the sixties.<br /><br />They look the same but the texture is different. Now I admit I know nothing about the candy business or how bubble gum is made but I do know companies use filler and often cheaper ingredients to make more money.<br /><br />The old type you could bite off a hunk and wind up with a wad of bubble gum roughly the size you bit off. And the more you chewed the softer it got.<br /><br />These Bubble Cigars once you have chewed them for about a minute turns into a small lump a quarter of the size you put in your mouth and the lump is so tough you have to spit it out- it is just too tough to chew. Like a piece of hard rubber.<br /><br />I admit they look the same and the flavor is close to the sixties but they are not anywhere near the quality of what we used to buy. The old kind you could chew for hours, blow bubbles with , and the flavor would last as long as you chewed.<br />These will do none of that.<br /><br />They just seem to be made from very cheap ingredients with about 70% filler.<br /><br />It's a shame because they used to be really good. But these are not what we grew up with.<br />It is very cheap bubble gum made in the color and the shape of the old Bubble Gum Cigars many of us used to love.<br /><br />Fortunately, they do not cost very much so you can try them yourself without being out too much money.",Not the same as the 60's
"summarize: The sauce in this meal is in a cup that sits inside the bowl with the pasta, with a flat tab that fits into the edge of the bowl. BE CAREFUL WHEN OPENING THIS! As you peel back the lid after cooking, you will want to keep your thumb on that flat tab of the sauce cup. There is a circle there so it's easy enough to see. It is very, very easy for that cup of hot spaghetti sauce to pull up with the lid and spill all over you, and it is hot when it comes out of the microwave!<br /><br />As for the taste, I thought these were good. The sauce was delicious, the pasta so-so. It's somewhat grainy pasta -- it's durum whole wheat -- and there is a hint of preservative flavor in it that the sauce can't mask. For non-refrigerated, this was very good, better than expected. You can't beat that it only takes 60 seconds to cook, and you don't have to leave it in the microwave after it's done cooking like you do with frozen. The flavor in frozen dinners is better overall, though.","good taste for non refrigerated, slighty iffy packaging"
"summarize: For a product that sells itself behind a liquor brand, I was pretty disappointed that the candies did not contain real liquor. A coworker of mine purchased some malibu chocolates as Christmas gifts for everyone. These candies were great and contained real alcohol but, rather than asking her where she purchased them from (because she more than likely wouldn't have divulged) I decided to look for them myself online.<br /><br />The image shown on Amazon is very vague and (at the time that I purchased) offered no product description. Far be it for me to sound like some kind of alcoholic but, mentioning the non-alcoholic nature of these candies should have been one of the least of things put in the description to help inform a buyer's decision.<br /><br />I understand that it might be tricky selling things of an alcoholic nature online when it may be difficult to verify age, but those chocolates my coworker gave were so tasty that I would've been willing to jump through (some) additional hoops in order to verify mine.",Chocolates DO NOT contain real alcohol!
"summarize: Like the title says, I'm fairly tolerant of low/no fat substitute foods....I don't expect them to taste nearly as good as the original, but imho, this was SO bad, I actually ended up throwing the jar away (which I normally NEVER do with food unless it spoils....). I can't even begin to describe the taste...it was beyond chemical-tasting. I really enjoy the ""Better n Peanut Butter"" brand of low fat peanut butter.  Although it needs to be kept refrigerated (or else it can get moldy in a few weeks after it is opened), it is fairly close to the original in both texture and taste.","I'm pretty tolerant w/ fat free substitutes, but I couldn't stomach this stuff...."
"summarize: I confess, I bought the last subscription to this item.  And I sure hope it will be back in stock when my 6 boxes are gone.  It is the only rice spaghetti I've found that is actually ""vermicelli"" and I love vermicelli, not the fat stuff!  It holds up like real wheat vermicelli, doesn't stick together like corn/quinoa thin linguine, and tastes and feels like THE REAL THING.  Also, you can smell the spinach powder in this product when you open the box.  I cooked it up tonight and my only recommendation is:  Use the longer cooking time and maybe even add a minute.  Be sure to check by trying to cut the pasta before you remove it from the cooking water.  As with most rice pastas, it doesn't plump up as much as wheat pasta.  An 8 oz. box provides enough pasta for only 2 small plates of vermicelli.  But still, it was worth it!","Best glutenfree ""vermicelli"" I've come across yet..."
"summarize: Usually, organic food tastes sweeter and is more tender than food with preservatives and bug spray in them.  This lot of Westbrae organic corn I bought from Amazon tasted oddly flat:  very little flavor.  It may have had something to do with the cans having arrived dented, I don't know, or it was just a bad crop, or, who knows if it even was organic?  Disturbingly, the cans were lined with that white plastic that is so controversial.  Does the plastic contain endocrine disruptors that are in the news so much lately?  I don't know.  I probably wouldn't have even noticed if it hadn't been for the off-flavor.  I'm still open to buying organic canned produce, but I won't be ordering this one again.",Unexpectedly flat taste (in a dented can)
"summarize: I purchased this as one of a group of items to test before buying for a trip. I chose this one because of the high protein content - 9 grams of protein per serving, or 18 grams for the complete can. Since it also has a relatively low carb count; it has 9 grams per serving with 3 fiber for a net carb count of 6 carbs per serving; it looked like a good choice.<br /><br />However, I did not enjoy this particular salad. The tuna tasted very ""fishy"" and the vegetables and pasta were very drab tasting. All I could really taste besides the tuna was the oil. Later, when I walked by the empty container in the trash I was overwhelmed by the fishy smell remaining. I can't imagine leaving the empty container in a car or in my trash can at work.<br /><br />It's OK, I would eat it if I were hungry, but it wouldn't be my first choice of meals. If you end up with this in a variety pack, I suggest heating it with cheese over the top, making a tuna casserole. A few crispy french fried onions on top of the cheese might really ""spiff it up.""<br /><br />Another thing to note is that the box says the container is ""microwave safe."" However there was an insert that said you should remove the contents from the container before placing in the microwave. Since the container is metal, I'd take the safe route and heat it in a microwave safe dish.<br /><br />An OK meal, but not great at room temperature on its own. I suggest if you want tuna for a trip to buy one of the packages with crackers, mayo, and pickles, cheaper and better tasting.",Fishy Tasting and Smelling - Oily Taste
"summarize: The very first time I drank Matcha tea, it made such a huge transformation in how I felt that I haven't let myself be without it since.  That's been about a year ago.<br /><br />I've tried one other brand--from Colorado, a gift from my sister--also the 1st Harvest Organic and 2nd Harvest non-organic in this DoMatcha brand, through Amazon. I like the DoMatcha brand best, with the flavor and effect of the 1st Harvest Organic being my favorite.  It's the Ceremonial grade made from younger leaves. It's the most expensive, though, and costs too much for regular use in my case.<br /><br />The flavor is secondary for me. The main reason I drink Matcha is that it has helped greatly with the mental fog, extreme lack of energy, and difficulty functioning and handling stress that I was experiencing.<br /><br />This 2nd Harvest Organic does the trick pretty well, and is an acceptable balance between expense, flavor, and beneficial effects. I look forward to having a cup after breakfast every morning and enjoy the flavor, but truthfully, I wouldn't care what it tastes like. ;D","Gives Me More Energy, Mental Clarity and Stamina"
"summarize: They don't look like they have that big of a layer of chocolate but the chocolate taste really comes through well.  And the peanut-butter chips are awesome.  Clocking in at 110 calories each these bars are a great snack for those of us who are dieting or at least trying to.  They give you all the sweetness that you are craving and are large enough to satisfy you until your next meal.<br /><br />These are going to be a no-brainer for me.  My kids both love these, my husband also says he thought they were really good - so everyone in the family likes them... even those not dieting - how can you go wrong with these?",Really great decadant taste.  Does not taste like it's only 110 calories.
"summarize: The benefits of organic Coconut Oil are endless and this brand is wonderful.  Another reviewer had warned about ordering cocounut oil in hot weather days. Coconut oil is liquid at room temperature, so it'll probably leak & evaporate from jar at 85*F+  (wildly guessing here).<br /><br />If you look at the same item in FL store shelves, their jars are kinda greasy too especially in the spring/summer months.<br /><br />I got my shipment today. Amazon did a superb job in packaging. And yet no matter how well packaged, the jars in bubble wrap, plastic bag & box, leaked the same.<br /><br />Gotta expect the oil to leak from jar while in transit in hot weather and also be prepared to do some smart cleaning upon receipt.  I suggest leaving jars in bubble wrap + bag. Place all on paper towels and put inside fridge for 1/2 hr. When oil is solid, remove wrappings. Rinse jars under warm water, use oil residue on hands, arms, face (never let a good crisis go to waste!)  Inspect lids & seals. All should be intact, maybe just a tad oily. After rinsing & once product is partially solid, there should be NO leaking from anywhere. If so, then the jar must be cracked. Remove oil and place in another container -- a glass jar would be best.<br /><br />The product is great and perhaps worth the hassle if ordering in hot days. Another option, would be to place orders in cooler months. No mess. No stress.",Great Product & Amazon Service. Expect Greasy Delivery in Hot Weather.
"summarize: For many years I was grinding my own beans each morning and having 2 cups of of Starbucks Pike Place Roast. I was convinced I couldn't wake up properly without it and never considered another brand or flavor.<br /><br />THEN the economy tanked and something HAD to be done to lower my overall costs. Enter Maxwell House Breakfast Blend!  After trying a few REALLY 'Brand-X' types plus Folgers I finally settled on these large blue plastic jugs of ground Breakfast Blend.  Using two small plastic scoops for a small 2 cup pot I am able to both enjoy my morning coffee AND save a ton of $$ in the process.<br /><br />In the 2+ years I have been drinking this coffee I have yet to run into a stale batch and the taste and strength seems pretty uniform as well. I REALLY like it.  I have found I need to be a bit careful about how much I use as you can easily cross the line from flavorful to bitter but other than that my experiences have been very good and quite stimulating!  Maxwell House is now my new best friend in the morning.  And if you measure correctly and use good bottled spring water it REALLY IS ""Good to the Last Drop"" !<br /><br />For the money I don't think you can beat this coffee and that is why I wrote this review and recommend it.",Excellent lower cost alternative to Starbucks!
"summarize: I can't say that I'm crazy about this stuff - it's not the best sweet tea flavor I've ever tasted (and I'm a fan of sweet tea) - but it's also not terrible. The container is cool - very easy to store and even easier to use (pop the top and squirt it into your water). It does take a good amount of the liquid to make your drink taste like sweet tea; the first time I tried it I used what I thought was quite a bit and still had a drink that tasted like watered down tea. After getting the balance right (too much vs. too little) I've worked out how to balance the amount of MIO with the amount of water, but I'm not particularly thrilled with the sweet tea flavor. Easy to use but I like water enough that I can't see using this that often.",Not great but not terrible (and easy to use)
summarize: I bought this same product in a health food store in bigger bags... BUT I guess it was not the same in the smaller bags.  They were called Parmesan Chips but they were not as crunchy and they were full of parmesan.  There was almost too much parmesan on the chips in these smaller bags and it seemed as though at least 1/4 the bag is parmesan.  They just were not as good as the bigger bag.  Maybe it was a manufacturing error... but I will not buy them again.  I really wanted them for a protein supplement to my snaks.  OH WELL.<br /><br />If someone gets these and they are crunchy then I really would like to know that.,OK but not as good as the big bags.

"summarize: I decided to try these Cedrinca candies mainly because they are eligible for free shipping (many of the ""gourmet"" products are not).  They are REALLY GREAT, and have the most intense honey flavor of any filled or unfilled honey candies that I have tasted.  The filling consists of quite a dollop of honey, so the candies are fairly large, and for a hard candy addict like myself, it's not practical to suck on them when I'm trying to carry on a conversation, or just have a hard candy discreetly in public.  For those situations I would recommend the Go Naturally honey candies, which are much smaller, and also eligible for free shipping.  In fact, the Cedrinca honey candies are so addictive that I keep them in an inconvenient drawer, so that I have time to think ""do I really need another one?"" before getting them out. On the downside, in addition to sugar and honey, the Cedrinca candies do contain ""glucose syrup,"" which according to Wikipedia is the same as corn syrup (I don't know if it's high-fructose corn syrup or not).  The Go Naturally products contain just ""Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Brown Rice Syrup, & Organic Honey"" - so they might be more suitable for people who are trying to avoid corn syrup.",Best honey-filled hard candies I've tasted!
"summarize: Have used about 4 of these tablets and the boost of energy was so great I had to cut it down to 1/2 tablet instead and found that for myself that was a more desirable effect.  Was a bit too jittery with a whole tablet.  I will say that personally I do not care for the taste, but I also dislike sugar-free/artificially sweentend products as a whole.  But I dilute 1/2 tablet in a very small dixie cup and shoot it down quickly and that works great.  I bought this as a substitue for Red Bull and/or the Advocare Spark due to cost of these products - Eboost is a great alternative.","Great boost, taste not my favorite"
"summarize: I was a bit wary when buying this product because I heard how nasty this stuff was, but it wasn't as bad as I expected. The main reason why I purchased this, however, was because of all the scientific articles published in the past about Acai Berry. With a simple search (on google scholar for example), there is a sufficient amount of evidence published indicating the high amount of antioxidants in Acai Berry extract. For those of you who don't know, antioxidants are extremely helpful in reducing various forms of cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, the nutrition label indicates that it contains omega 3 and 9, which are also found in fish oil, an extremely useful supplement to reduce cardiovascular disease as well. The following are a few recommendations to summarize:<br /><br />Recommendations:<br />-DO NOT mix with cold water, it won't dissolve fully. Furthermore, don't mix with water in general, it tastes really nasty. I'd recommend adding it as a supplement to a yogurt or smoothie, it tended to drown the taste away while getting the full benefits.<br />-Make sure to refrigerate after opening, the statement was not very large when I first opened it.<br />-Take between a half to full scoop (provided in jar) rather than the recommended 1-2 scoops. Adding more than 1 scoop will really drown away the taste of what ever liquid you are adding to.","A Bit Bitter, But Great Overall"
"summarize: I'm flabbergasted by the glowing reviews that ""truffle oil"" is receiving on Amazon! Those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny [...] bottles of ""truffle oil"" are made in a laboratory. There's not a molecule of actual truffle in them. It's a sinful shame that's perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening New York Times article called ""Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles."" Read it and weep: [...]<br /><br />And if you see ""truffle oil"" advertised on the menu somewhere, you might ask if they're using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes...","Truffle Oil? Well, at least the oil is real."
"summarize: I don't consume a lot of artificial sweeteners but I do like them occasionally.  For the past several years, Splenda has been my drug of choice and while McNeil's new entry Nectresse, is fine, I see no compelling reason to switch.  Simply stated, Splenda tastes good, is readily available and has never caused me any problems<br /><br />I do like the taste of Nectresse although it doesn't seem to be quite as sweet as Splenda and it does have a slight aftertaste.  I don't find it particularly objectionable but it's definitely detectable.  A big plus for Nectresse (and for Splenda) is that it can take heat without breaking down.  You can cook with it and not alter the taste or lose the sweetness.<br /><br />Nectresse's ingredients as listed on the label are, in order: Erythritol, Sugar, Monk Fruit Extract, Molasses.  The first, erythritol, is a sugar alcohol commonly used as a zero calorie sugar substitute.  It's sweet (although not as sweet as sugar), it tastes good and most people have no trouble with it in limited quantities.  However, it has been known to cause digestive upset in some.  While it's a condition more uncomfortable than dangerous, why risk it?<br /><br /> I would certainly choose this over many other brands of artificial sweeteners but Splenda remains in first place for me.",It's fine but I still prefer Splenda
"summarize: As one reviewer said here, this used to be good but not anymore.<br />I don't know what they started adding to this but it makes me sick.<br />I won't go into details, but let's just say it's a real pain. In the guts.<br />What a shame they took a good thing and ruined it.<br /><br />I only eat this sort of chocolate for the health benefits. Nothing relaxes the<br />arteries and keeps the brain fed like cacao. Studies have shown benefits such as<br />keeping the plaque off brain cells and staving off Alzheimer's.<br /><br />But I can no longer stomach this brand. I've never had such an intense stomach ache.<br />I know it's not a chocolate intolerance since other brands don't do this to me.<br />Whatever it is it is toxic to my insides.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, there are other brands that I like more. I'm not a fan of the way any of these intense dark chocolates taste but for the remarkable health benefits I eat a very small piece every day along with taking a daily asperin.",Tastes bad and give me cramps
"summarize: Item arrived quickly and frozen on dry ice.  After sampling a thawed container, I have to say this is the best canned mango product I've tried.  It was very sweet like a fresh mango should taste....NOT like the typical flavorless mango mush in heavy syrup.  This would be good for anything requiring mangos from a fruit smoothie to mango nut bread to mango wine.  I've got 6 gallons of mango wine going and so far so good!<br /><br />I also contacted The Perfect Puree's customer service before ordering and they provided me with the information I needed on sugar content.<br /><br />Will definitely buy more and possibly try some of the other purees they sell.","The BEST ""mango in a container"" product ever!"
"summarize: I love Near East Couscous. I always have a few boxes of couscous on hand for ""emergencies"" when I had no time to cook and I am in a hurry. Not only do I like the taste it is the easiest and fastest thing to prepare that I know.<br /><br />Couscous is a coarsely ground pasta made from semolina, a type of wheat. When cooked it is light and fluffy, not gummy or gritty. Instant couscous already has been steamed and then dried again before it is packaged. To prepare it it only needs be soaked in boiling water until it swells, a process that takes only a few minutes. You don't even need the stove.<br /><br />To start, measure out your couscous.<br />Pour it into a heatproof bowl.<br />Add hot water - the general proportion is 2 parts couscous to 3 parts water. So for 1 cup of couscous you'll need 1 1/2 cups water.<br />Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit for 5 minutes.<br />Fluff with a fork before serving.<br /><br />Couscous doesn't have a lot of flavor on its own, but it works well as a base for vegetable or meat dishes. I have not found anything does NOT go with it.  I like it with chicken, fish, lamb, and beef. I especially like it with the dishes have sauce as couscous absorbs the sauce so well.  It also mixes well into salads and can be flavored with herbs like coriander, basil. It's a great base for all sorts of dishes.<br /><br />I recommend it. It is a must have in my pantry!<br /><br />Ali Julia review","I love the taste, and it is my ""emergency"" food"
"summarize: IN A NUTSHELL: THE CORNERSTONE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN DIET<br /><br />This Goya ""EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL"" is one of the smartest buys one can make. This is ""Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Imported from Spain and is stated to be ""All Natural & Cold Pressed"". Bear in mind that ""All Natural"" is not ""Certified Organic"".<br /><br />WHAT EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE IS USED FOR:<br /><br />That being said, this is not an oil for cooking, as it has a very low smoke point. It is excellent for salads and for marinating and boasts a pretty low acid level. For cooking try their ""Extra Light"" product as it has a much higher smoke point.<br /><br />HEALTH BENEFITS: CARDIO-PROTECTIVE<br /><br />PROVEN PROTECTION AGAINST ATHEROSCLEROSIS:<br /><br />Eating foods high in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), [found in Olive, canola & flaxseed oil] will increase the blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids. ALA has been shown to confer a large measure of protection against atherosclerosis. As part of the ""Mediterranean"" diet, researchers used products high in ALA, and found that the ALA reduced the risk of dying from heart disease by 70% over the first 27 months.<br /><br />Canola and Peanut oil also contain large amounts of ALA and are similarly cardio-protective. The presence of a larger proportion of ""mono-saturated fats"" is central to the cardio-protective properties of the oil.<br /><br />-----*- NO Cholesterol -- -*- No Trans-Fat<br /><br />WHICH SIZE IS BEST FOR YOU?<br /><br />This and most of their conventional oils are available at most groceries and this exact product sells for about $3. for 8 ounces. However, it does vary regional and depending on the packaging [bottle or tin] may cost somewhat less by volume. Bear in mind, that Olive will become rancid if you store it for prolonged periods. You can, however, extend this period by keeping the oil in a cool and dry place, preferably dark. Also, don't buy the largest containers unless you can finish them within 1-2 months. Smaller containers like this 8 ounce bottle may be more costly per volume than the liter or gallon size containers, but the oil will be fresh when you use it and that is critical.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]","TERRIFIC TASTE AND HEALTH BENEFITS TOO -- SMALL SIZE ASSURES FRESHNESS WHEN YOU USE IT!,"
"summarize: I wanted to try halvah and see how it tastes. So I bought this brand. I like the taste and it wasn't too sweet than I anticipated.  It has a semisoft texture, little sweet confection once you bite into it. Later, you can munch on the sesame seeds coarse texture, and it does melt in your mouth. I received a 4 pack gift box, which is a lot for 1 individual but this is great for sharing and gift giving.<br /><br />This is a great snack, if you like Middle Eastern or Israeli sweets. I prefer the walnuts with vanilla and the vanilla flavors. The marble halva had some chocolate into it, but it felt grainy and there are bitter chocolate powder tones to it.  The portion size is little big too, and they cut it into small, thick square slab of halva. Each gift box contains 4 of each of these flavors: vanilla with walnuts, vanilla and marble(chocolate and vanilla).",Good halva... perfect for gift giving
"summarize: Of all the foods that my Persian likes, duck is by FAR his favorite.  So, since I haven't been able to find much canned these days, I saw this bag of food and thought I'd finally saved the day.  No so! He wouldn't even TRY this stuff and it sat in his bowl for over a month! No kidding, we left him alone for a day while we were swimming and he starved himself over eating this food. About had my leg taken off when I returned home too (and if you've ever seen the size of a Persian's feet, you know that that was a near amputation...). The kibble is a bit larger on this food so if you're buying it for a cat with a smaller mouth say, oh, like a Persian, then this might be an issue. But if not, then maybe you'll have better luck than I did! Thinking the size was putting him off, I actually broke some into smaller pieces.  But, it was the taste - he wouldn't even eat it out of my hand.  It's a great natural food (but the kibble looks dark green, ewww!) without animal by products, but if they won't touch it, well, guess there's nothing you can do about that. Try it - but try it at your local petsmart first because if you get a slap from your cat as you walk by, well, they'll take it back and give you something else!

"summarize: I have two mastiffs; an English and an Italian (aka Cane Corso). As owner of giant breeds Im always looking for the best products for my babies. With a recent lay off I needed to slash my budget without compromising the health of my girls. Naturally I was searching for a holistic food that caters specifically to the needs of giant breeds. I was ecstatic when I found this food. The ingredient levels were nearly perfect and had extra minerals good for joints too. All natural food with chicken being the 1st ingredient and at a great price especially since im buying for two. I compared it to Blue Buffalo, which is great but still a little pricey, the labels were almost identical. What a God send! Unfortunately, neither one of my girls liked the food. They disliked it so much so they did not eat for 3 days. I added a little water to release the aroma, I soaked it in chiken broth, they just didnt want it. Maybe my girls are spoiled. I would recommend starting with a small bag to see if your dog likes it. As for me, the search continues.","I love it, my dogs dont :("
"summarize: This starter is an amazing and well-balanced culture. You can smell the potential in it when it first arrives.  It's supposed to revive by the second day of feeding it, but I found that it almost immediately picked up with bubble action after the initial feeding.

I'm moderately experienced with sourdough starters and the only starter I've ever used that rivals this starter is one that I was given as part of a baking class years ago from a baker in Boulder, CO -- and that starter had a San Francisco lineage.

He has used them since he was a week old, he is now 11 months. This is the only bottle that didn't leak. There isn't multiple pieces, or certain ways to put it together so it would work. So night time feedings were quick. With the bottle at a slant, it helped with the air bubbles.<br /><br />I did not give it 5 stars though, because it is a bit of a pain to clean.

"summarize: I have nothing but praise for this product. It arrived well packaged in a paper bag, which allows it to breath and stay fresh when the customer gets it, and that bag sealed in plastic to protect it from the uncontrolled environments it might encounter during shipping.

And yes you will inevitably crash from it. (I did.) It does taste better than red bull and about the same as Rock Star.

UFC fighters and BJJ black belts did not run away in fear.<br /><br />This really isnt a bad drink, I was just hoping for something different or better or healthier than EVERY OTHER energy drink out there. Instead it just seems to be trying to cash in on some sort of bad a$$ mystique. While pumping you full of carbonated water, HFC and citric acid. (Also contains Soy?!?)

"summarize: Barley water is renowned in ""knowing"" circles, for it's tendency to create faultless complexions.  Some of the MOST famous beauties have used this beverage -- the company, Robinson's, was, as stated on their label, founded in 1823!  At least 2 generations -- probably many more -- of world-famous English beauties have used it.  (A hint as to who these beauties are, and were, is on the back label of the bottle.)<br /><br />I had heard of the value of barley water from a thin red book, which sadly has disappeared during the intervening years. I almost didn't buy this barley water, as I was afraid of a pebbly consistency.  However, I bought it and I am very glad I did!  The barley here is barley meal...very finely ground, and in any event, only 2% of the contents.  It tastes quite smooth and delicious when you drink it, either hot or cold.<br /><br />And this 33.2 ounce bottle is a CONCENTRATE!  The label directions suggest one part Robinson's Barley Water to four parts of water -- more water if it is given to young children.  These directions make emminent sense, as barley is often used in the manufacture of whisky.  No -- I doubt that anyone could ever get drunk from barley water...because the barley is un-fermented.  Still, the barley maes this otherwise lemonade-concentrate quite -- or even middling --strong stuff.  A little goes a long way.<br /><br />So, I'd recommend this for everyone.  Those who wish to have clear and radiant skin, to those who will not drink alchol, and for those who like lemonade.  As I haven't researched this product other than tasting it, I am sure there are many benefits to it that I have missed.  Yes, it does have some preservatives...but these are kept to a bare minimum in the content.<br /><br />The benefits of barley water should be better known, especially in the USA.  Robinson's Barley Water seems to be the very best!  Don't forget to dilute it..and drink it for your health, for good taste, (it's good taste -- and yours!), and for tge legendary benefit of totally beautiful skin!",F A M O U S.......B E A U T Y.......S E C R E T !!!!!!!

The vet told me he didn't have crystals, and after two visits they still couldn't figure out what was wrong with him.

When you get the teas it says to add a Tsp for every 6oz but you almost have to triple that amount to get any kind of distinction of taste from the teas,  the only one at all that has any taste for the amount directed is the mint tea which with its powerful aroma is no surprise.  All I can say is this isn't worth the price try another seller or just stay with the teas you like now,  because even for Amazon prime members who can get the free two day shipping $25.00 dollars for this poor level of quality tea is not worth wasting your money on.

"summarize: or as my nine year old said ""it tasted a LITTLE better than it looked"", which I can tell isn't very good.  So let me preface this review by the fact that the only boxed food my kids ever get is boxed rice like rice pilaf, and prior to trying this I have NEVER fed my family this type of meal, so they certainly aren't used to something like this showing up on their plates.  I mention this only because I spoil my family with food that is easily identifiable and that alone may have put them off from this dish.  We had to force the kids to take a bite of this and they both thought it was just awful.  My 7 year old got up and made himself a ham sandwich and let me tell you he is the type who likes to be waited on, so I can assure you he was motivated to not have to eat any more of this stuff. On a more positive note, the directions were super easy to follow and it was done in 20 minutes.  On a negative note, the supposed brocolli looked more like brown flakes mixed in that in no way resembled brocolli or even the picture on the box.  I was so dissapointed, since we always eat fresh veggies with every meal, that I had to cook some fresh brocolli and add it in so I didnt feel so awful about serving it.  In addition, my husband and I didn't think it was as awful as our kids did, but we didn't think it was good either.  Basically, my husband suggested it was the type of stuff that might be served in a homeless shelter, at which point my nine year old said ""I don't think even the homeless would like to have to eat this.""  In conclusion, this was a waste of perfectly good chicken (as well as the brocolli I added) and we won't ever be having it again.",It wasn't as awful as I thought it would be....

"summarize: I bought the Artisana from [...] where it was $11 instead of $13.  I also bought finely shredded ""Let's Do Organic"" coconut.  The Artisana was good, but the flavor not as ""coconutty"" as I had hoped.  And, unless I nuke the jar, it shaves off when I try to scoop it--like cutting into frozen butter, an annoying chore.  It is better when warmed.<br /><br />I followed one reviewer's suggestion and now make my own.  I use my Blendtec (a super blender like a Vita-Mix, both of which will grind concrete), but I add in some warm water.  It whips up smooth (no granuals) and fluffy like icing.  Once you add water, you do need to refrigerate the mixture, as the water, over time, will make the coconut go sour.  I put it in my Asian curry veggie soup, and it worked great, and it is tasty on toasted nut bread.  I also mixed in some dark chocolate chips, a little sweetener, and made a very tasty chocolate mousse.  So the Artisana experience has greatly enriched my life--but only because I have learned to make my own.",Nice Flavor but Very Hard at Room Temp
"summarize: Well, first off, I guess I should say that this review is going to be a bit different.  I got this for an unusual reason.  I have no baby, I got this instead to make special jello treats for my pet garden snails.  Yes, you heard me right - pet snails.  So, this review is for all you snail owners out there!<br /><br />I love the fact that this product is organic and has no added filler/preservative junk.  If you keep snails you know that they are very sensitive and delicate beasts and you have to be careful about feeding them stuff with added chemicals.  Disturbingly, though, mine was already expired by the time I got it (it expired July 2012).  I'm assuming it'll still be fine, but that means that this stuff goes bad super fast or I got a case that was already really old.  Either way, it makes buying huge cases of the stuff from amazon kind of questionable.<br /><br />Now, onto the actual use.  I wanted to make jello treats for my beloved snails.  This involves taking about 6 oz. of baby food and mixing it with about a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin.  This makes a sort of vegetable gelatin.  The snails liked the jello treats okay, but it turns out that they liked the baby food just straight much better.  Go figure. Well, either way, the fine puree of baby food is a great way to get them to eat stuff they might normally be picky about (for example, if you are having trouble getting them to eat their calcium supplements, you can hide calcium powder in the baby food).  I've also found that it doesn't mold all that quickly in a snail tank.  In fact, it lasts longer than bananas, which was very surprising.  As for the disturbingly fast expiration date, even though I haven't tried it yet, I imagine you could freeze it in ice cube trays or tupperware and then defrost it later.  I've tried this with fresh ground veggies and it worked fine with those so I imagine it would work fine with the baby food.<br /><br />This is a decent  choice for snails, but I should mention price.  I bought some baby food in my local grocery store that had absolutely no added preservatives/chemicals in it, and it was about 17 cents an ounce.  This is 51 cents an ounce.  SO, much more expensive.  In fact, if I hadn't gotten it through Vine, I wouldn't have bothered to buy such an overpriced baby food.  So, if you have pet snails, this is a fine enough choice for them but maybe a bit overpriced.  Personally, though, I'm just going to stick to using leftover fresh veggies and grind them up in a food processor and freeze those for later use.  However, if you're feeling lazy, really want something that can store longer than fresh veggies, or just want to give your beloved snails a soft mushy treat, then organic baby food would be a fine enough choice for your snail-feeding needs.",A Decent Treat for Pet Snails...
summarize: Nutricity is the very worst ever place to order.  I ordered almond butter thinking it came in a glass bottle and when I received it it was packages in plastic.  I returned them and they send me an email saying they did not receive returns.  When I tried to get in touch with them with their 800 number a recording said they only handle returns via email.  I will never ever order from them.  I highly recommend that nobody ever orders from them.  When I ordered I never read that you couldn't return an item.  And then to top it off I could not talk to anyone in their company they handle all via email.  VERY DISSAPOINTING!  DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THEM.,Nutricity is the VERY WORST EVER place to order from
"summarize: NOTICE TO ANY PRESCRIPTION DRUG PATIENTS ... it is not clear on most liquid stevia products how many of them (this one included) utilize ""grapefruit seed extract"" as an additive (typically as a natural preservative). If you take any medication that restricts or suggests avoidance of grapefruit ""juice,"" I strongly recommend that do a bit of research before relying on the ""seed extract"" issue as not be included as a concern. My research has shown that grapefruit ""seed extract"" can have the same impact as grapefruit ""juice"" relative to interfering with how some medications are metabolized or absorbed. It appears they (grapefruit juice and/or seed extract) actually have the ability to render some drugs almost completely ineffective.  I have been a long term user and advocate of the positive benefits of grapefruit seed extract as a supplement (natural anti-fungal, anti-yeast, antibacterial, etc.); however, really had not expected that grapefruit ""seed extract"" might, in fact, end up as an unexpected additive and, more specifically, that it (seed extract) would end up showing the same evidence of drug interference as grapefruit juice does with two of the drugs I am required to take. I already knew about ""no grapefruit juice"" at all, but no mention of the grapefruit seed extract connection. Of course I understand that this product includes an incredibly small percentage of the seed extract, unfortunately, I haven't found any conclusive information regarding any ""acceptable"" amounts of the seed extract or data addressing any sort of ""volume"" thresholds of juice or seed extract.  I'm disappointed I can't use this product anymore (and wish I'd known this sooner and/or even thought to ask my doctor or pharmacist sooner); however, I FEEL SO STRONGLY that I should introduce this issue to anybody else this might effect regarding health recovery, maintenance, or quality of life. --  PLEASE ALSO NOTE:  I only gave one star to enable this to post (and hopefully get any appropriate individual(s)' attention). This was a five star product for me for quite some time as far as quality of taste, overall value, and excellent ""blend-ability"" with any kind of fluid or food ...  it really is one of the best if you have no restrictions. I'm sad I can't use this type anymore. I do now, however, use some stevita packets that I like, and am trying a couple liquids that are available that don't have the grapefruit seed extract additive (or at least not listed) ... I'll post a review if/when I find one I can confidently verify as grapefruit seed extract free.",AN INGREDIENT CAN INTERFERE WITH MEDICATION
"summarize: FIRST -- Let me tell you that I am the type of person who -- while not fat, does need to be aware of weight issues and watch calories.  A woman reaches an age where even a former skinnywinny has to do that.  And I am a former skinnywinny who used to eat the entire bread basket and ask for more at a restaurant before the meal even arrived. I love bread. . . all kinds of bread.  And I hate having to limit how much I eat of it these days. So, three cheers (or 30) to Wegman's food for producing the only product I've ever found to satisfy my craving for bread -- and for ONLY 16 calories per slice . . .er, per ""popcake.""  I've tried Ak-Mok, flat bread, pita bread, Ry-Krisp, home-baked, wheat thins, salt-rising, oat bread, seven-grain, organic, beer bread, sour dough, high-fiber/low fat bread, Trader Joe's mini-muffins, the 45-calorie slices one of the bakeries puts out, hi-fiber low-cal white tortillas (which aren't horrible) . . . but this stuff ACTUALLY DOES quench my bread cravings with minimum calories and maximum satisfaction.  Forget those puffed rice cakes! Yeeccchhh! Like eating styrofoam.  Plus, they crumble all over the place.  But these are heaven.  I cannot get enough. Or, rather, I CAN get enough to satisfy me so that I do not have to stuff my face on actual bread. Maybe it's the shape. They're about the size of a tortilla, only puffy. Texture is similar to the rice cakes, except for the ""mouthfeel,"" (I understand this is a technical term that professional food tasters use, ha ha!). These feel a little ""slick"" in your mouth, which is so much better than rice cakes and, somehow, they are not as dry. They're a little ""glossy"" on the tongue, not ""matte"" and flat.<br /><br />You can cut them in half and put sandwich spread on them, such as tuna fish, or diet mayo, cucumber, and thin slices of lunch meat or roast beef, or ham and mustard.  Then cover them with the other half and you have a sandwich! With only 16 calories of bread!  Or, you can even eat peanut butter and jelly.  IT's easy to spread them with tub/bin-style margarines or butter substitutes... Or, even whipped butter if you want to pig out.  Or, eat them with a thin trail of honey drizzled over them.<br />However you use bread, you can use these (except for French toast -- I'm sure that would NOT work.)  I have not put them into the toaster yet, but I might try it on low at some point. (They might shrivel or burn fast . . .I don't know.  But my instincts tell me they'd be okay on the ""low"" setting, and just get brown and even tastier. I love to put soft boiled eggs on them with salt substitute and pepper, though I boil the eggs until the yolk has thickened a little and isn't really too runny anymore because if you put really wet things on these, the liquid WILL bleed through and drop on your blouse or something.  I would NOT put pickle relish on them (too wet), or tomatoes (unless I covered the ""popcake"" with a layer of mayo, butter, or a big, wide lettuce leaf).  I did eat them with a pretty runny egg once and the egg dripped out through a soaked crack in the popcake.<br /><br />I think the thing I love most about them is that, while they are mostly AIR, they actually TASTE like yeasty bread.  And they are really crisp.<br />I can eat a whole one during the afternoon -- either along with shaved carrots and Laughing Cow lite cheese, or with a piece of low-fat, or no-fat cheese and cucumber and mustard or lite mayo.  It's flavor, plus texture...  I suppose if I sprayed them with butter spray, and sprinkled them with that yellow ""popcorn salt"" that you can buy in some grocery stores, I could sneak about 7 of them into the theater in my purse and be very happy guzzling them down and pigging out on them for about 112 calories.  That would get me through a movie... ha, ha.  I could have my ""popcake"" and eat it too!  Normally I do not go on and rave about products.  And I realize it's a matter of personal taste.  Some people might find them a bit styrofoamy due to their airy texture.  But I am so grateful to have found a substitute for bread that actually has that ""bready"" taste, something that I can use for sandwiches (which I love) and still feel satisfied, that I am celebrating the crispy texture rather than complaining about missing that yielding, semi-moist texture and fragrance of fresh-baked bread. I feel like I've just gone to Marshall's and bought a Ralph Lauren Black Label Evening Gown that fits great and looks like dynamite for only $10.99.  If you have to buy $30 worth of these, or 10 of them, to qualify to purchase them online, I believe you will not regret getting so many UNLESS THEY GET STALE DURING SHIPPING.  I would not know about that.  I got mine at Whole Foods in Massachusetts.  Not sure if they're available on the West Coast -- I've not ever seen them there.  And never at a standard grocery store like Ralph's, Von's, Safeway, Market Basket, Albertson's, or other chains.  Just Whole Foods, though some of the other artisan-style foodstores might -- just might -- carry them.  You might check the actual Coco foods site by doing a search engine search.  Anyway, I think this is one of the best diet aids EVER! Hope this helps.  And no, I do not work for the company or have any relatives working for them.  I usually am a bit critical of products.",So far this is the ONLY product that satisfies my craving for bread
"summarize: I have sensitive skin that is prone to getting dry, particularly during the winter months and dry weather. I thought I would give this new line a try and it was alright. The scent is just right as it is not overpowering but definitely detectable, although I can understand some people being turned off by it.<br /><br />The primary moisturizing ingredient in this body wash is the same as in many others - petrolatum. Those saying that this body wash does not moisturize enough - I would recommend letting the lather set on your body for at least a minute or two. Petrolatum is not an instantaneous moisturizer and needs some time to settle on the skin to do its job. Try aiming the water off of you as you lather and let it set for a couple of minutes. Even with this technique, however, this body wash just isn't as moisturizing as it says, especially in comparison to Dove 'Deep Moisture'.<br /><br />Overall - I liked this body wash. I'm rather picky with my personal hygiene products and Dove For Men passes with an average score.","Good body wash - refreshing, but lacking"
"summarize: My wife and I have always been of the belief that it is best to give your children food you have personally prepared and so we tried to stay away from excessively feeding them `baby food'.  We have kept food on hand for convenience especially when we're on the go.  One thing my wife and I have found is that these Baby Gourmet pouches are certainly the better `baby food' product out there.  Sure, you're talking about pears, which are rich in natural sugars and may not be the food you want your little one gobbling down, but in my eyes it is far better than many of the processed foods parents feed their children regularly.  In fact, if you glance at the list of ingredients here you'll see organic fruits and vegetables that (shocker) actually match up to the description on the front of the pouch.  My youngest still gulps these down when we're out and about as a hold me over for dinner (yeah, these really aren't `meal' worthy, but more of a snack).  They are tasty (yes, I've tried it)...you can really taste the pear.  All in all, this is a good product that I'd recommend to parents looking for a healthier alternative to their child's snacking.",A tasty treat for a growing baby...
"summarize: These are great ice-cool mints with a sweet peppermint flavor.  They don't sting or assault your senses, but they do freshen your breath. They are a little stronger than the generic white and red peppermint hard-candies that restaurants set out in bowls, and these give you a nice cool sensation like a york or junior mint. As these mints age (say a year), they also mellow.<br /><br />With so much mint gum, it's hard to find a good mint tablet.  Many alternatives have caffeine, crunchy shells, or are uncomfortably intense.  Not these. They are just perfectly balanced.<br /><br />I stumbled across these mints about two years ago on a 3000 mile road trip.  Since then, I've purchased several 9-pack boxes.  I've never seen these at stores since my original purchase.  Dentyne has a companion flavor to these ""ICE"" mints, called Fire. I have seen the fire mints in stores.<br /><br />As far as use, I keep these between my bed and bathroom.  I used to have a habit of waking up hungry and ""sleep-eating"" when I'd get up to use the bathroom.  I've retrained myself to grab a mint instead.  Since they are sugar free, they don't rot my teeth.  And, since they aren't too strong... they don't wake me up too much.  I just suck on the mint until I fall back to sleep.",Great Mint - Hard to Find
"summarize: I try to purchase only organic dried fruit to avoid pesticide residue and sulphites and decided to try these Newman's prunes.  I think they are great!  They are really plump and moist and delicious to ""eat out of hand"" or to use any other way you use prunes.<br /><br />My husband thinks he doesn't like prunes so I mix them with dates, nuts, cacao powder, a little almond butter or tahini, vanilla and a bit of agave in my food processor and make no bake/no flour ""chocolate brownies"" which he absolutely loves.  You can also add just a bit of water and grind the prunes into a paste to use as a replacement for half of the oil in chocolate cake or cookies. I'm happy to munch on the prunes right out of the package.  I think you will be also.<br /><br />Oh yes - Amazon's price is much lower than our local grocery store or even the food club I belong to!",Really good fat and moist prunes
"summarize: My dog is allergic and my vet suggested to change its food. After reading the ingredients of this product, I thought it would be a good option. When the product arrived, I mixed it with his previous food to make it a gradual change but my dog only ate the previous food. Maybe he didn't like the taste. I had to feed him in the mouth but he vomits it. The first time this happened I thought it was maybe due to anything else so I feed him with Nature's variety food again and he did vomit again.

You will have a good idea how my cats react after I open a can of the aforementioned cat food.  I stick to the established routine as one cat needs medicationed mixed into her food.  In any case I put down each cat's plate in a certain order.  If I go out of the usual order chaos results.  My catstypically gulp down the tuna & egg mixed with dry food in 7-10 minutes!

The food critic has spoken!",All 3 dogs love this food and the first ingedrient is beef
"summarize: My cat, who is of average pickiness, loved both of the chicken varieties.<br /><br />The Sesame Chicken looks and smells appealing, even to humans.  It's very recognizable as shredded white-meat chicken, finely diced carrots, and broth.  No chopped-and-formed meat by-products here!<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie variety is a little smellier, but not as bad as typical cat food.  It is fairly soupy, but my cat lapped it right up.  She even ate the carrots, which I would not have anticipated.<br /><br />Both products list high-quality ingredients on the label.  There is no wheat gluten, so hopefully this product is less susceptible to the melamine poisonings that have occurred with other brands.  It is made in Thailand, and I don't know what that means in terms of pet food safety.<br /><br />I like the size of the mini-cans, as they are just right for one meal for one cat.  I hate keeping smelly half-open cans of pet food in the refrigerator!","Looks and smells high-quality, kitty likes it"
"summarize: I've been struggling to find the right dog food for my Giant Schnauzer Stella who suffers from digestive issues.  I was told that grain-free food was the way to go since the grain was probably causing her allergic reactions.  I bought Artemis and after going through three large bags of this formula, her digestive issues have only gotten worse. She has very loose stools and passes the most awful gas.  Even her body odor has gotten worse, and she requires baths every other week.  Her energy level also decreased significantly.  I was at my witt's end after going through various types of premium dog food including Artemis most recently.  Bottom line is, I dropped they dry kibble and I've been feeding her homemade chicken, rice and veggies with a multivitamin powder mixed in for extra nutrition, and her symptoms have all disappeared.  I don't care what anyone says, dogs do need carbohydrates (grains)!  Stella has regained her energy, her coat is shiny, her eyes are bright and her issues with the loose stools and gas have disappeared completely.  I know, this seems like a tremendous chore, but it's easier and cheaper than you think.  It's a lot better than having to clean after her loose stools...lol..I make her meals in bulk and I freeze the food into separate portions for the week. For variety I feed her chicken liver or the beef special of the week.  No matter how ""premium"" a dog food is, it will never compare to real, whole proteins, veggies and starches. There are tons of easy dog food recipes on the internet. If you are struggling with the same issues and you only want the best for your baby, please at least try it for a few weeks. He/she will love you for it!!!","Great dog food in theory, but...."
"summarize: I bought these back in January and never got around to reviewing them. I had heard many people rave about a Japanese snack called Pocky so I figured I would try it out. Just like the description states, its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate. I wouldn't say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess, well, as long as the chocolate doesn't melt. Anyways, in case anyone is wondering, I ordered from a seller named Very asia (amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html?ie=UTF8&isAmazonFulfilled=0&orderID=103-7071944-5595443&marketplaceSeller=1&seller=A3JW437I54SEI1). I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me (maybe it had to be imported) but when it did, it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever. I'm definitely considering re-stocking on this in the future if I can't find a local store<br /><br />EDIT: Oct 11, 2012<br /><br />*****Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchase*****<br /><br />So I decided to restock after I couldn't fight the craving anymore. Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good (ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime). What I received was not the picture shown on the front page (2 per pack japanese pocky), it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from Thailand. In my opinion, the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste, more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth, this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth.<br /><br />Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a) not eat everything at once and b) avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. I can honestly say that I won't be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much. I won't change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3. The taste isn't ""terrible"" but its definitely not to my liking. If possible I will be uploading some pictures of what I received.",Great tasting snack...if you get the Japanese Pocky
"summarize: BUYER BEWARE! This caused severe intestinal bleeding and an inflamed stomach lining in two of my toy poodles who had to be taken emergency, to my nearest animal hospital!

I don't know what possessed me to switch, but I'm so sorry I did!!! They seemed a bit rough, like an old piece of leather, very coarse, not the usual kind of texture my dogs have been used to. I didn't think much of it at first, because they eat these types of treats all the time and they are supposed to be the ''nautral choice'' only healthful, not harmful! But, I never knew the damage they would cost my dogs. They began to become very listless after digestion, severe bloody vomit and explosive, watery diarrhea with blood followed, almost to the point of shock!!!

"summarize: I am on a strict gluten-free diet as I have gluten sensitivity. I started using this product, assuming it was gluten-free, as it is naturally and doesn't have any added ingredients. Well, after continually having problems when eating my baked goods and researching all of my products, I found my answer. This manufacturer produces many flours and they make it clear on their website that this product is not intended to be sold as gluten-free.<br /><br />Their statement is as follows:<br />""Celiacs and those with a wheat intolerance on special diets can find rice flour, tapioca flour and even sweet potato flour which has been produced in dedicated, gluten free mills to prevent cross contamination.""<br />[...]<br /><br />Any other products from this company are at risk of cross-contamination. So, I should have done my research, but I didn't understand the need to. The lesson here is that a product cannot be accepted as gluten-free unless labeled as such.

"summarize: If there is such a thing as a dog taste-test, Purina's Beneful has definitely passed it in this house.  My larger dog, who is part hound, could smell the nuggets right through the Amazon box and bag.  Yes, both of my dogs will eat almost anything, but certain flavors get them more excited.  They barked and continued to beg for little treats.  Indeed, my Brandy has her head lying right next to the bag waiting for a bit more.<br /><br />One thing I especially liked was the QuickZip feature that will enable this food to stay fresh.

"summarize: It took a month for delivery.  The stated time was 2-9 business days.  The delivery was shipped the day AFTER I complained to the company,(Gristedes in New York),...HMMMM.....UPS couldn't figure out how to deliver to a P.O. Box?????(I have had numerous packages go UPS to USPS to P.O. Box) To make matters worst the shipment was short 2 packages of product.  I think next time I will stay on the West Coast for faster delivery and a little extra $$$$. GOOD LUCK if you order from Gristedes Market in New York!!!! (And, remember to stay on top of the order to make sure that you actually get it.....)The ONE positive note was that the product was AWESOME as far as freshness and presentation!!!",Should have ordered from another source?????
"summarize: As a native Southerner, I've eaten grits all my life but I'd never had yellow, coarsely ground corn grits before I tried Bob's. From the moment my family tried these grits about two or three years ago, we've eaten no other grits. We cook these grits every weekend, usually Saturday and Sunday mornings. Oh, we've tried a few good regional products, but they're just not as good as Bob's (for instance, Lakeside yellow grits are good, but because they're more finely ground, Lakeside is a bit too creamy, tasting almost like a corn porridge). I prefer the more coarse grind of Bob's yellow grits, and the flavor is exceptional. The corn flavor in Bob's comes through, but not in an overpowering way - not to sound like a geek foodie, but Bob's yellow grits have a fantastic taste and mouthfeel. It's hard to explain, but I recommend you try them. If you're not sure you want to bite off a bulk multi-bag purchase via Amazon, then check your local grocery store (Publix in the Southeast carries Bob's, as do many organic/gourmet grocers). Regarding price: Bob's Red Mill products aren't cheap, but the company fills a very unique niche (Gluten-free products, unusual flours, etc.) and I'm willing to pay the price to keep the company from disappearing. Plus, every product from Bob's Red Mill that I've ever tried has been superior, including these grits.<br /><br />Oh, and NEVER follow the cooking directions on a bag or box of grits - that's the primary reason non-Southerners think grits are nasty, because they make grits without the necessary amounts of butter, salt and milk or cream. Also, these are not quick cook grits, so it will take about 15-20 minutes from the time the water boils to achieve smooth, cooked grits. To feed four people (assuming you also have pancakes and a meat for breakfast), use three cups water brought to a boil, then gently shake about 2/3 cup of grits into the water. Once the water/grits combo comes to a boil, immediately lower the heat to simmer and stir frequently. [A note about lumps: if you don't stir often enough, you get lumps; if you dump the grits in, rather than shaking them in slowly, you get lumps.] Add two or three tablespoons of salted butter, then an unholy amount of salt. I'm afraid to measure how much salt we actually use (we salt to taste as we cook), but I would guess we use two or more teaspoons of salt. To avoid oversalting, start with one teaspoon of salt, taste when you're almost done, then add additional milk and salt to taste. Depending on how thick you like your grits, add additional water (we prefer to use 1% milk) to thin them out a bit. You can also add chopped bacon or country ham to your final product for flavor.<br /><br />A word about polenta:  Any Southerner can tell you that grits left in a pot to cool become polenta... so go ahead, and impress your Yankee and West Coast friends by ""grilling up"" leftover slices of your breakfast for dinner. Remember, the Americas introduced corn to Europe (including Italy), so grits came first.",Fantastic Grits that Can't Be Beat (recipe included in review)
"summarize: I don't use a lot of commercial baby foods as I tend to make most of what I feed the grandchildren. However, there are times when you want to be prepared with something quick and this fit the scenerio of ""the baby needs food NOW"" very well.<br /><br />Other reviewers have commented on the ingredients, the nutritional value etc. So I won't go into any of that. What I like about Baby Gourmet Juicy Pear and Garden Greens is the on-the-go ability. I keep a diaper bag packed in the car at all times as well as a diaper bag that I take places. This product along with several others (yogurt snacks, baby cookies, jars etc) comes in handy when you are out somewhere longer than you expected to be or if you are going on a picnic at the park or somewhere that doesn't offer baby-friendly foods--you know no apple juice or mac and cheese. The container is heavy duty in that nothing has punctured it yet, squirts well into a small bowl, and the baby likes it.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to anyone that is a busy on-the-go mom or dad or grandparent. Because it is organic though, make sure you watch the expiration dates. And if you do keep some in the car for hunger emergencies, if any is left it needs to be stored in the refrigerator.",A great fruit item for when you need something quick
"summarize: These crunchy sweet golden nuggets are tasty, and thankfully for those of us with poor impulse control, in small portion pouches (one 130 calorie pouch = 3 Weight Watchers Points Plus).<br /><br />I wasn't that thrilled with the Fudge drizzle; it didn't taste bad, it just didn't have much taste. An occasional hint of chocolate, but mostly just waxy blandness. Thankfully, it's just a light ""drizzle"", and not a full coating.<br /><br />I don't know if they offer this option, but I would prefer just the plain caramel corn; without the fudge drizzle, they could increase the portion size a little for the same calorie/points value.",Caramel Corn = YUM! (fudge drizzle = meh.)
"summarize: I have lots of bugs everywhere: under my deck, on top of my deck, beyond the deck, in my front yard, in my bushes, in my flower bed.  So I was given this by a neighbor and sprayed both her lawn and mine with it.  The only thing that this seem to bother were the black thatch beetles (not japanese beetles)that apparently don't do much harm to lawns.  I just saw them scatter about with a few dead ones on the lawn after I sprayed. Other than that, the little black ants are still everywhere, as are spiders, and springtails.<br /><br />All in all, if you have a really bad bug problem like I do---don't use this because it's too weak.  This made no real difference in killing the bugs I wanted to kill.",I literally sprayed bugs with this; they flipped me off and kept going
"summarize: I use this sweetener in place of sugar because it doesn't have any calories and I don't get that ""sugar high"" and the feeling of being hungry again after I eat regular sugar.  I'd like to give up sweeteners completely but I just can't get used to oatmeal without the added sweetness or some salad dressings that need the intense sweetness without adding another flavor.<br /><br />This doesn't have an aftertaste like some of the other artificial sweeteners do and from everything I've read it seems to be safe.  I like the little packets because it's easy to measure just the amount I need.  I also like that it's not affected by heat and can be used for cooking and baking.",Tastes sweet and no after taste
"summarize: Nutritional value for the 2.5 oz bags of Seneca Crispy Apple Chips:  Caramel....<br /><br />Servings per container:  2.5<br />Calories per serving:  140<br />...from fat:  60<br />Total fat:  7g<br />...Saturated fat:  1g<br />Total carbohydrate:  20g<br />...sugars:  12g<br />Ingredients:  apples, canola, sunflowers, safflower oil, corn syrup, sugar, maltodextrin, modified corn starch, citric acid, ascorbic acid, natural flavor, caramel color<br /><br />These chips are tasty, but they are super sweet.  I taste the caramel flavor more than the apple itself.  Definitely a great snack food, but not as healthy as I would like.  I will probably buy the sour apple variety next time to see if there is a difference in nutritional value.  You definitely get the bang for the buck buying these in bulk.","Love them, but definitely not a ""healthy snack food"""
"summarize: I've been buying Buffalo Bills brand of jerky for over a year now. I wish I had known about them before - their products are always fresh and full of flavor; and their shipping is always, always on time. I do pretty much all of my gift shopping online and a few months ago I started buying this company's 6-packs coolers (they have quite a few different ones to choose from) for birthday and congrats gifts.<br /><br />I've sent this particular 1.75oz Beef Jerky Cooler to 4 different people this summer and each one really enjoyed it. If you're looking to send a gift and you're not certain what kind of jerky the person likes, then this is the one to send. It's a great assortment.<br /><br />On a personal note, their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FZ0TL0"">Buffalo Bills 3.5oz Honey Pepper Country Cut Beef Jerky Pack</a> and their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FYXBPW"">Buffalo Bills 3.5oz Teriyaki Country Cut Beef Jerky Pack</a> are the 2 best jerkys I have ever eaten.

"summarize: A coworker of mine asked me to purchase this for her for the office, but she told me it was a coffee. I searched and searched, then realized it was hot chocolate. She was clueless - all this time she thought she was drinking coffee, and this stuff is so sweet, thin, and the color is disgusting. She's 27, but she must have never drunk coffee before. So, when I tried it, I thought for sure it would have a bit of a bitter taste to it, and I would have to add sugar/creamer, but this stuff is so over-the-top sweet, it's just plain sickening. (When I drink hot chocolate, I like to put marshmallows in it, but there's no way with this one. I had to pour it out.) Would not recommend for traditional hot chocolate lovers.",Yuck! I love hot chocolate but this is sickening!!!
"summarize: This is real stevia extract without any additives. Most of the companies that claim to be selling stevia are really selling stevia extract combined with other things, like fiber or artificial sweeteners, but this is the real deal. It's extremely sweet, which means you only have to use a small amount at a time, and you should melt it with hot water if you plan to put it in a cold drink. Stevia also tastes a little . . . different. (Some describe it as tasting like licorice, but I never thought so). I suggest starting with the smallest amount and then upping the quantity until you find a level of sweetness that tastes good to you. Because of stomach problems, this is the only sweetener I use, and I like it very much. I highly recommend it.",Real stevia extract with no additives
"summarize: The first time I used this shampoo, I was really surprised how my hair felt when I rinsed it out.  It rinsed out really clean, unlike the Aussie I had been using for two weeks, which leaves a coating on my hair.  I think the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9FQ"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a> makes a good clarifying shampoo.  Also, my hair did look better the first few times I used it.  (I wash my hair every night.)  But then, the shampoo seemed little different than the others I used, and my hair didn't look any different.  Thus, I just started alternating it with my other shampoos--<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F51PWG"">Aussie Moist Shampoo, 13.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GQ6GLK"">Garnier Shampoo Daily Care, 13 Fluid Ounce</a>.  Unlike those two, the Clear Scalp does have a slight perfume smell, but it's not a strong scent and it doesn't linger.  Good for those of us hyper-sensitive to perfume scents.",Good Clarifying Shampoo . . . .
"summarize: I bought these because they were recommended as a way to get finicky seniors and sick cats to eat.  My sick cat had to be coaxed to eat them, and they made her vomit almost immediately.  My other cat, who has IBD, likes them fine but doesn't love them, and they do not cause any ill effects in him.  I split the difference and gave them three stars for what the cats think, and I added a star, because these aren't processed and full of questionable ingredients.  I wouldn't feed them to a cat who has CRF (although they are all different, and what doesn't work for mine may work for yours), but I would recommend them over kibble treats (except Greenies - we love <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WUVZCK"">Feline Greenies, Beef, 3 oz. Package</a>).","Made CRF kitty violently ill.  IBD kitty likes them, though."
"summarize: This granola was WAY to sweet, WAY WAY WAY too sweet, and it was lacking nutty goodness I expect in a granola.<br />The dark chocolate used in the granola was very good, I found myself picking out the bits, as the sugary coated oats was just too much for me.<br />Well, not JUST sugar, it really was evaporated cane juice (AKA a sugar), Brown rice syrup (AKA another sugar) and molasses (AKA another sugar) on top of the SUGAR and DEXTROSE already in the chocolate pieces.<br />I think my pancreas is in shock. Why so much sugar?<br />And why are the only ingredients (other than the sugars) basically oats and chocolate? How about some nuts?<br />This is basically dried oatmeal and chocolate bits held together with SUGAR.<br />I like a sweet treat, but this is overboard. I would think using 1/2 or less of the sugar in this would have left it tasting naturally sweet. And the addition of SOMETHING, anything other than plain oats would have been a welcome addition for the tastebuds.<br />Nope, for a wholesome snack this didn't do it for me. If I could describe it in two words it would be : SUGARY BLANDNESS.","Too sweet, even for a treat!"
"summarize: For those of you not familiar, ""crunchie"" bars are solid honeycomb coated with a relatively thin layer of milk chocolate. Personally, I love 'em! They're one of my all time favorite chocolate bars. They're popular both in England and here in Australia where I live.<br /><br />Not much more to say except that you can buy crunchies in a variety of pack sizes (size being determined by the number of bars included), and this 6-pack is the smallest. I've also seen packs of 12 and 24, as well as bags of ""treat sized"" mini-bars for sale. Although prices on Amazon do fluctuate over time, as of the time of writing, this 6-pack will wind up costing you just a fraction of a cent under $1.40 a bar. Weirdly, that actually works out cheaper per bar than if you buy the 12 pack; although the 24 pack definitely offers the best value of all at just a fraction over $1.12 per bar. So if you are going to go to the trouble of buying chocolate bars over the internet, it may be worth your while buying MORE!!!<br /><br />That said, it's not like these are a health food. So please... Enjoy in moderation! ;-)<br /><br />Theo.",Mmm... One of my all time favorite chocolate bars! :-P~
"summarize: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014VTNW"">Marmite 125g</a><br />Marmite is one of those things that people seem to either love or hate.  I'm in the former camp.  I think the way I was introduced to it has a lot to do with my positive impression.  Marmite is very salty and rich, it's almost like a bouillon cube softened with butter.  Well, not quite that salty.  The British friends who gave me my first taste knew how to eat it and taught me right.  /;+)<br /><br />The British supposedly eat it on their toast to help boost their Vitamin B levels, as tea inhibits the absorption of B vitamins.  And we all know the Brits drink a lot of tea.  I look upon it as a stress reliever that tastes good, too.<br /><br />Try it on toasted French bread, spread with lots of melty butter.  Then, ever so lightly, spread a thin, very thin film of Marmite over the top.  It should be barely tan on the ridges of the bread's surface, unless of course you find you like this salty spread, then have at it.<br /><br />Tea, toast with Marmite, and a simple scrambled egg make a satisfying and tasty meal.  Give it a try.<br /><br />Added 10 May 2008:  I posted this review before tasting the ""new"" Marmite.  I had been using up my stash of Marmite from before they started getting PC and health conscious and all that nasty stuff.  The new Marmite is less flavorful, thinner, and really not too appealing for a fan of the original version - I think it must be the veggie-no meat flavor.  You can carmelize veggies until the cows come home (heh!), but they will never have as rich a flavor as beef.  Unless, hmmm, maybe miso???  That's got a pretty rich flavor without meat.  Maybe I need to add that to my ""new"" Marmite.  Excuse the digression.<br /><br />If you've never tried Marmite before, never fear.  It's still got all the positives I mentioned at the top, but, for us fans of the beefy version, it's a little tame.",A light hand does the trick.
"summarize: The flavor of Italian sausage comes through in this product, but it is not overpowering as some Italian sausage can be. The fennel flavor is mild like it should be (in my opinion) and my only addition to this would be adding a little more red pepper to kick it up a notch. Some can't handle spicy, so I guess I will just have to 'doctor' it up myself. It is good for a quick meal (about 20 minutes from start to finish if hamburger is not frozen). Add a salad and some garlic bread and you have a complete meal.",Good Italian Sausage Flavor without the Italian Sausage
"summarize: I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.","Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me"
"summarize: This drink has a very distinct taste of ginger as advertised, along with subterranean hints of lemon that are overpowered by ginger. What messes up the balance flavorwise is the sugary flavor.<br /><br />The serving suggestion for a hot drink is one pouch with 250ml of hot water. (250ml of water is just under 8.5 oz).<br /><br />This is a rich drink (compared to tea), so if you prefer something more lightweight, you can use one pouch to make two cups instead of one.<br /><br />Since the nutritionists say ginger is good for you, it raises its rating. As just a drink, it is closer to 3.5 stars.","Spiced drink, sugary flavor messes the balance"
"summarize: One of the ingredients on the label is ""Natural Flavors"" which is glutamate in hiding.  Glutamate is a neuro toxin which can destroy your dog's health.  The company is very deceptive.  They avoid giving a direct answer.  They call glutamate a vegetable extract which it indeed is, however, when one component is extracted, it creates an imbalance that can be harmful.  I will say this.  My dogs like it, but that is the purpose of glutamate, a flavor enhancer.  Added later:  Why should anything need to be extracted to enhance the flavor of quality food for pets or humans for that matter.  I now make many of my dogs meals from mostly raw ingredients and give them Organix dog food when I need a quick meal.  For those who are concerned about their pet's health, I suggest the book ""Natural Health for Dogs and Cats"" by Dr. Richard Pitcairn, D.V.M.","For a Healthy Dog, Avoid This Dog Food"
"summarize: Good Ole NutriCity - They ALWAYS are WAY OVER market on their pricing, and then they add exorbitant shipping that always seems to cost as much, or more, than the item?? We have a so called (very pricey/spendy) ""Gourmet Market"" near our office and they price these exact beets at under three dollars - this NutriCity price works out to almost five dollars per jar - there it is. Buyer beware........  However, these Aunt Nellies Harvard Sweet & Sour beets are unusually gooooooood! So tasty right out of the jar, they are even better added to a salad, or rinsed and patted dry for a appetizer tray before dinner. BUT the BEST reason to buy these awesome BEETS is the HARVARD BEET CAKE recipe on the jar! It is the BEST spice cake you EVER tasted and gets a whole lotta veggies into your kids on the sly!!

"summarize: For the men at our house Peter Pan Creamy Peanut Butter is the staff of life.  They  don't spread it on their toast - they frost their toast with it, making thick delicious swirls.  They're not above just scooping a spoonful out of a jar and enjoying.<br /><br />  Now, the best price for Peter Pan Creamy that I could find in our area was $3.98 for a 12 oz. jar.

I tried the Really Raw Honey - OH MY GOSH!  Hands down - the BEST honey I have ever tasted!  When you open the jar, you notice it has a beautiful fragrance!  It tastes like honey and flowers - it is so smooth, flavorful, delightful!  No preservatives, no heating, no pesticides... Just like if you went out, took a knife and scraped a bee-hive.  Soooo GOOOOD!<br /><br />One reviewer had an issue with it not being ""organic"".  I would just like to say that the bees are local to where the manufacturer is.  They pollinate on flowers that have not been sprayed, harvested.... They are providing as pure and free-from-by-product honey as you can get on the market today.  And remember - organic, although better than off the shelf produce/meat/eggs... does not mean free-range, local grown.... That is a whole different topic that I could go on about.<br /><br />A note on the cappings (crust as some put it), that is a very important and enzyme dense feature.  It is to be eaten.  It is DELICIOUS!!!!!  When you take a bite, it is sweet - like the honey, and chewy like a yummy treat.  Then after that, it is chewy like gum - which is bits of wax from the honeycomb.

"summarize: This coffee is weak and a major disappointment. I gambled on this coffee because of the 3 positive reviews. I bought a 24 pack of the Mocha Nut Fudge and I'm seriously considering tossing the 22 remaining k-cups. Sad statement.<br />It's advisable when there are hardly any reviews to look elsewhere for MORE reviews. I found some other sites with dozens of reviews of this coffee and my thoughts on it were confirmed.. I'm not crazy :)<br /><br />How is it disappointing? Well, there is virtually NO flavour. It is a light roast coffee.

"summarize: Apparently I didn't know honey. I grew up near beekeepers, I've had tons of ""wild honey,"" most of it clover and ""misc"" based. Most of such honeys are dark orange, but still see-through, sometimes with comb in the jar.<br /><br />This stuff... I didn't know what to make of it. First, it's from a radically different flower source which might be part of it (aster flowers or something), I know all honey looks and tastes different based on its source. But it's as different from ""normal"" honey as say, homemade burgers are from fast food, or grapes are from grape candy -- it might as well have some new word that would define it as something uniquely its own.<br /><br />1 - it is completly opaque<br />2 - it is cream colored, sort of<br />3 - it has all this stuff as a layer on the top which is a mixed combo of pollen, comb, etc.<br /><br />#3 has become my favorite part. Now I want smaller or wider jars so I get more. :-)<br /><br />The taste of it, as far as pure honey goes, is divine. But I actually like clover honey better I think (I grew up with it maybe is why), but that isn't any fault of the product, just a personal thing. If I could find clover honey processed the way this company does it, I'd be all over that.<br /><br />Once when horribly nauseous, I verrrry slowly sucked on a spoon of this and it settled my stomach. Found that in a home remedy cure site (earthclinic dot come) and was amazed it worked. (Sniffing peppermint essential oil also worked for that.)<br /><br />I honestly feel like this honey can't even be compared with honey from any other source that I have seen.

I imagined it being muddy water or tainted (I may just be weird like that). I made the mistake of smelling it before i took my initial sip, BIG mistake. It smells like an old penny that has been at the bottom of your purse. So, I grinned and took a sip. It has a thick and oddly slimy consistency. It doesn't even TASTE like water.

"summarize: The name says everthing about this lovely tea.  Sweet chamomile apple is like drinking a golden delicious apple.  The scent is strongly fruity and chamomile. The flavor is apple, chamomile and honey--a wonderful golden flavor that is soothing and while sweet, not cloying.<br /><br />Chamomile tea is known for being a nerve tonic, settling upset stomachs, and soothing menstrual cramps and headaches.  Having a cup before bedtime is a nice way to relax.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag.

I searched the new can, knowing it appeared simular but could not find the 10% as it was cleverly hidden in the back. I then went to my recycle bin for an old can and compared. No longer proudly displayed on the front 50% real juice. I have justified this expensive,tasty and addictive treat for years and alloted 1 per family member per day.

And, as consequence, those coffee lovers may begin to hate their new Senseo -- but take heart! Many online coffee shops now offer decent to delectable coffees at prices that rival this cheap swill. I don't specifically want to endorse any one product or online retailer but do a google search for ""senseo compatible pods"" and you'll find several on the first page. Also, please note that while these may initially seem pricier, most third party pods work with JUST ONE to make an 8-ounce cup instead of the two pods that Senseo brand products demand. You do the math and it works out to be a comparable costing cup of joe.<br /><br />[...]",I wish it could be ZERO stars!!!
"summarize: I spend a lot of time looking at recipes.  I follow several food blogs and foodgawker is a daily addiction, which is how I first heard about s Biscoff Spread.  In one day, on several different recipe sites, I kept seeing Biscoff mentioned.  The first was for a cookie ball made using biscoff, since the recipe poster said you could substitute butter for the Biscoff, I mistakenly assumed that Biscoff was a butter alternative that I hadn't heard of before.  But later I saw it mentioned again and then again on different sites and with increasingly rapturous praises for this 'amazing delicacy' and I just had to find out what it was.<br /><br />I'm just that way, if all the cool kids are eating Biscoff, I need to know what Biscoff is before I dismiss it as a trendy waste of time.<br /><br />As it turns out Biscoff is not new.  At least in Europe it isn't and after just one tiny taste of the heavenly stuff, I think I can safely predict that it will soon be a regular product on store shelves in North America.<br /><br />Like others before me have mentioned Biscoff is sweet and has a texture somewhere between Nutella (sticky, hard to spread if it isn't at a room temp and whipped cream cheese, airy and light, easy to plop onto a cool bagel (the weather has been super cold here and still the Biscoff was spreadable with a spoon right after delivery).<br /><br />The texture is smooth with a slight powdery-ness and it tastes sweet. just like a cookie.  In fact, it tastes like cookies, which is so strange that at first I wasn't sure if I liked it, so I took another bite and it was blissful, sweet but not too sweet, just the way I like my cookies, nom nom.  Biscoff is a melt-y, buttery, cookie delight, I like it even more than Nutella and I have an urge to hide the jars, so that I wont have have to share them with my husband and son!<br /><br />While Biscoff is tasty alone, it felt like I should try it out on something, I put a smidge on a thin ginger crisp, yum, tried some on a slice of apple and then a smear on a piece of toast (my bread was stale and kinda yecky, so it wasn't that great).  The options are flipping endless.",How can a jarred spread taste like cookies?
"summarize: This is a really excellent seasoning.  I first had it at a Boy Scout camp in New Mexico, where it was around for every meal and was put on *everything*.  In an environment like a Boy Scout camp, where food is mass produced and isn't of the greatest quality, this stuff is essential.  It makes everything palatable, which is great.<br /><br />I didn't find the stuff again for about 10 years, when I was surprised to see it on the shelf of my local grocery store.  What amazed me that although it is excellent in making mediocre food better, it also makes *good* food taste better, too.  I don't use it on everything, like at camp, but it's great for things like seasoning home made french fries or potatoes.  It is a bit salt-heavy, so you should know that ahead of time, but if you like moderately salty foods you'll enjoy it.  If you haven't had this before, get a smaller, single jar before getting the large six pack.<br /><br />You should know that a six-pack of 17-oz jars is a LOT of seasoning, and the expiration date is about 2 years from manufacture - there's almost no way for a single family to eat this much seasoning in that time.  I bought this to give some away as gifts (my family loves this stuff too, and it's hard to find).  If you don't have any plans for these besides eating them yourself - look for a smaller package than this.",Excellent seasoning;  be mindful of the expiration date
"summarize: When Columbus and Vasco de Gama sailed from Spain and Portugal in the late 1400s they were looking for sea trading routes to get ""pepper"" or spice.  Spice had been carried west on the caravans for centuries and it was expensive.  Since long pepper may be the original spice that supplied the name pepper (from Sanskrit) to round pepper and chili pepper I wanted to try it.<br /><br />The flavor is far milder than black pepper.  To get the same level of heat I had to use more than 5 times as much.  No problem once I learned that but I didn't expect it.<br /><br />There's far more to the flavor than the simple hot that I know from black pepper.  This stuff really is a spice in the sense of added a complex and rich flavor to food.  It's a pepper in the sense of adding hot, but think of the intense heat of horseradish and the mild heat of most mustard preparations.  In horseradish there are other flavors but the predominant feature is its type of heat.  In mustard there is some of the same type of heat (look out for Indian mustard oil or a mustard mixed from powder just before use) but most preparations have a lot more to their flavor than that.  Prepared mustard gets used as a condiment for that reason.  To think of black pepper versus long pepper think of horseradish versus prepared mustard.<br /><br />The flavor reminded me of Worcestershire sauce somehow.  It's not an accurate description of the subtle and rich flavor but it is the closest I can think of.  Okay, maybe more like the least distant I can think of.  Think of the difference between Worcestershire and soy sauce - It's the part of that is different.  I can tell it's somehow related to allspice as well as to black pepper, but it also has some sort of deep rich aromatic flavor of its own that I have not had in any other spice.  If you think cloves and allspice and cinnamon total two spices because of their overlapping flavors you'll like the fact that long pepper brings something new to the table.  The overlap with black pepper and allspice is not it's primary flavor.<br /><br />Because of the aromatic nature cooking it greatly reduces the amount of flavor it contributes.  If you want to put it in before cooking experiment some and you'll end up using it by the teaspoon.  If you want to use it sprinkled on the food just before serving it's a lot milder than black pepper so you'll end up using maybe 5-10 times as much as black pepper but less than teaspoon amounts.<br /><br />I bought it for the romantic history notions.  I use it because it's a nice spice that brings something different to the table.  Not an oh-wow-more-please experience, but it is delicious and a hey-this-is-different experience.",Long pepper may be the original caravan spice
"summarize: I don't think these coffee bags are as good as fresh ground fresh brewed coffee, but they taste far better than instant coffee.  At work, we have a water cooler with hot water dispenser.  This brewed in hot water just like a tea bag making tea tastes far better than any instant coffee.  I highly recommend it to any coffee lover when you have access to very hot water but don't have access to a coffee maker.  Individual wrapped and sealed bags allow you to take one tiny tea like bag with you in your pocket or purse to your early morning meetings.",Very Convenient and far better than instant coffee
"summarize: I don't normally even drink tea but tried this out in the cafe onboard a cruise ship.  It knocked my socks off with the aroma and spicy taste, to the point I knew I had to track it down once I got back on land.  It still hasn't turned me into a daily tea drinker, but it's the only tea I stock in my house!  I'm not saavy enough to say if the teabag version is worse or better than the satchel version, but I stick with the latter because it just adds to the novelty of the tea drinking experience, somehow.  This item has proven to be a very warmly received gift by a couple of friends, one who loved tea and one who loves spicy flavorful drinks.",It's a dessert in a tea bag
"summarize: Diamond Almonds<br />Almonds are a good source of magnesium. One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"" or ""happy bowels"" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

"summarize: Remember the old cereal commercial about MIKEY?  Well, my CRF cat isn't named Mikey, but it's still as shocking that she likes it!  At first, neither of my cats, the CRF cat nor the healthy one - cared for this food.  However, now that she's feeling a bit better with a holistic vet, she and healthy brother LOVE this food.  Little miss picky is eating it with gusto.  I am one that believes that the low protein diet for cats is never a good thing (dogs yes, cats no).  So most times I mix this with something like another high protein cat food, or human canned tuna - to bump up the protein count.  The controversy with the protein levels for CRF animals is basically in a nutshell, dogs are NOT carnivores as are cats, thus low protein is good for them with CRF - but cats ARE carnivores and require protein (and fairly high amounts at that) to live healthy.  So, this is a great mixer food for her, and as long as she'll eat it, I'll give it to them both.  Thanks NEO for a nice juicy food that tickles her fancy!",She likes it - MIKEY likes it!
"summarize: When I ordered a bouquet of pink roses to be delivered for my mother's birthday, I placed the order much later than I should have and I included in the order a special request to Spring in the Air to expedite delivery in a tight, actually unfair, time frame. I received a personal response from the company that they would make a particular effort to ship the roses in time -- from Columbia, South America to Ohio, USA! They also contacted my mother to expect the package. They kept me notified by email of the progress of the shipment. Unfortunately, due to a FedEx delay, the roses were delivered the morning after the requested delivery date. That was not the fault of Spring in the Air, who updated me several times with the delivery information. I still would consider it a lightning speed delivery.<br /><br />  When the roses arrived, my mother was ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED! She told me there were enough roses for her to make two beautiful bouquets, and each rose was in the perfect stage of bloom and without any blemishes due to the EXQUISITE CARE the company took in packaging the flowers. She was amazed the stems on the roses were so long! They were absolutely PERFECT and FRESH cut flowers! She was so happy with them! Because they barely missed the requested delivery date, though through no fault of theirs, Spring in the Air credited the purchase price. I will certainly use this company again. I can't write a review glowing enough to express my satisfaction with my order and my pleasure in dealing with a seller that gives such terrific customer service!",Five stars Plus for product quality and GREAT SERVICE!
summarize: JFG is an excellent mayonnaise made and sold in the south. My family was in the grocery business back in the 30's through 80's. The JFG salesman made weekly calls to keep us well stocked. JFG was best known as a coffee manufacturer.<br /><br />I ordered the 4-quart case a couple of months ago and had it delivered to my cousin in Kansas where you cannot buy it in the stores. My father and his brother (my cousin's father) both made pimento cheese using JFG mayo. My cousin's son made a batch soon after the mayo arrived and can now make several more batches.,I grew up on this mayonnaise
"summarize: I love this time of year...pumpkin spice everything!<br /><br />So I really had high hopes for this!<br /><br />And...it's very tasty.  Smooth, creamy (like a lot of the Maxwell House International Coffee mixes frankly) and you can really taste the cinnamon and hints of nutmeg and other spices.  But...there might be a kiss of pumpkin flavor but it's not strong (say as in a pumpkin latte from Tully's or Starbucks).  I was a little disappointed by that.<br /><br />It's also fairly sweet on its own...there was a touch of bitter aftertaste though so I've been adding half a pack of splenda to a thermos of this and it solves the problem.  But if you don't like sweet at all, too bad...it's light but the pre-sweetness is there.<br /><br />That said, I really do like it.  I just wish it was more like the ""pumpkin pie in a cup"" another reviewer claimed that made me really hope for just that.","Fairly tasty...not as ""pumpkin-y"" as I was hoping"
"summarize: I spoke to a woman at India Tree at length about their ingredients. She said that for a short run of the product, they used a formulation that included propylene glycol and polysorbate to help preserve them and keep them from separating. They have since changed their formula BACK to the original with just vegetable color, water and citric acid. What you see on the ingredients label is CORRECT.<br /><br />That said, these colors are not nearly as vibrant as I hoped they would be, but given they are not chemical colors I can't complain too much. My food allergic daughter gets to enjoy fun colors now, so I am happy.",India Tree DOES NOT contain toxic chemicals.
"summarize: I cannot tell you how much i adore dried fruits, and mango slices are my absolute favorite. However, moving to the US from Ireland (where dried fruit is just that - naturally sweet and delicious) i found i was bitterly disappointed to discover that most of the widely available dried fruit here is heavily sugared and, in my opinion, completely ruined.<br /><br />I finally found these guys and they're a regular purchase for me at stores, but they are vastly over-priced here on Amazon. They've been hiked up to an excessive amount similar to the ridiculous pricing of such quality dried fruits in health food/vegan stores that aren't Trader Joe's, ie. aren't good for your tummy AND your wallet.<br /><br />It's sad that you can buy a near poisonous meal for a family for $10 at a 7eleven or Tedeschi, but the same amount of money at a health store or co-op like Harvest (my local grocery here in Boston) will barely get you a container of dried fruit or 3 decent bell peppers. How are people supposed to change their lifestyles and improve their health for themselves and their children if the good stuff isn't affordable and the ramen and pop tarts are .45cents? It sends the wrong message and is the absolute propagation of disease and obesity. We need more places who share the values and philosophy of Trader Joe's - customers first, accessible, unpretentious, understandable health education, feel-good food at a feel-good price. Thank you Trader Joe's!<br /><br />Rant over :)","LOVE the product, deducting one star for the high price"
"summarize: I was very excited when my local store started carrying this product. I saw this as a relatively cheap alternative to the raw diet I had them on which was great quality but took a lot of work to prepare (the pre-prepped one was even more expensive).<br /><br />For anyone who's done research on dog food, we all know that raw is the best diet we can feed our dogs, it gives them nutritional content, probiotics, moisture, all the things that they need to thrive. For anyone who's been on high grade dog foods, you also know that you can switch foods for your dogs without any concern about stomach/bowel issues. Be forewarned, this is NOT the case with Sojos.<br /><br />I had been feeding my dogs Nature's Variety Instinct Raw (switching as I please between the protein varieties) and Orijen (I switch between all the Orijen flavors). I normally did half in the morning and half a night using one type of food for each feeding. I figure, why not throw Sojos into the mix to give them some variety and save some money. That's when problems instantly began.<br /><br />They liked the food at first, it was new and exciting and they gobbled it up, then when it made its way through their system, they had very runny stool. It was still not too bad and I could understand minor transition time, but by the end of day 1 it was full on diarrhea. I spent an entire weekend (and then some) nursing them back to health, fully on Nature's Variety Instinct mixed with organic pumpkin to settle the stomach. But I spent the majority of my time walking them, and being heartbroken to see bloody stool (knowing I had caused it by carelessly choosing a poor quality dog food product).<br /><br />I know some will argue, 'you didn't transition your dogs,' but honestly, when you stay in the high quality spectrum of dog foods you don't have to. Especially when you know your dogs don't have problems. I've fed them Blue, Candiae, Nature's Variety, Great Life, Orijen, Acana, Nature's Variety Instinct Raw, Earthborn, EVO. And that's not even adding to the mix the versions of those foods that have grain and grain free varieties. I've NEVER had a problem with switching them back and forth.<br /><br />So, this is certainly a better option that Science Diet, but it isn't for everyone, and it certainly isn't for people who want to feed their dogs the best stuff they can. This is NOT a replacement for a raw diet. Please take caution before switching.<br /><br />(Also I read a reviewer who cooks their proteins before feeding it to their dog, how does that not completely defeat the purpose in feeding raw in the first place?)","Caution, Not as High Quality as they would lead you to believe."
"summarize: I sent several 'fun' food items like this one to my 3 nephews to help them celebrate the holidays - all three are currently serving in Afghanistan (Marines, Navy and Air Force). While I'm not sure what condition  items will be in upon delivery there, I'm pretty certain they won't last long. I tried to think of items that might bring back childhood memories and thus nice Christmas memories as well. I didn't think chocolate would make the trip into that heat well, so I tried to make other choices that would still be fun to open and fun to eat. (Doncha know I completely forgot to send the santa hats I wanted to send!!!) :(<br /><br />I'll be back to update the reviews if my nephews (or at least one of them) lets me know how well the goodies were received.<br /><br />Merry Christmas to all and God Bless our Troops, keep them safe and bring them all home soon.",Sent to nephews stationed in Kyrgyzstan so jury still out

"summarize: the fiber content of this ""powder"" is amazing but the the taste and texture are almost unbearable. while hemp is not going to taste as good (by good taste-i mean an absence of taste) as soy or whey, it should at least be better than this.<br /><br />my gripes:<br /><br />texture- this product should not be called a powder at all. it's more like the contents of a tea bag. the product should be more finely ground.<br /><br />taste- this hemp has a stronger taste than other brands i have tried. i haven't found anything that really goes well with the ""earthy"" taste.<br /><br />the good news:<br /><br />fiber-i believe one serving provides 54% of the DV. that's 2-4 times as much as other hemp powders. this is why i gave this product 2 stars instead of one.<br /><br />the good news about all hemp:<br /><br />it's not highly processed like whey, soy, rice or other protein powders.<br /><br />it's organic. most hemp powders are organic because hemp is naturally resistant to pests. ever wonder why you never see organic soy protein? hexane. this is the chemical (similar to gasoline) that must be used to isolate the protein from the bean.<br /><br />it's raw. yay!<br /><br />other brands:<br /><br />i have tried nutiva, ruth's and living harvest. i currently use and recommend living harvest. it has the best consistency and taste. ruth's contains slightly more vitamins than living harvest but has a slightly stronger taste. nutiva is by far the worst with the strongest taste, grainiest texture and least vitamins.<br /><br />i find that the best recipe for a hemp smoothie is just a frozen ripe banana (use one with lot's of brown freckles-it may be a little gooey going into the freezer but as with banana bread, those bananas have the best taste), 2-3 drops of vanilla extract, some soy or almond milk and a scoop of hemp. hemp doesn't really seem to agree with berries or non-creamy fruits.<br /><br />bottom line-unless fiber is your #1 concern, go with another brand.","great for the colon, not so great for your taste buds..."
"summarize: About a year ago, I was diagnosed with acid reflux and a superficial ulcer.  While my doctor was great at discovering my problem, besides prescribing the standards prescription medication, she offered no other salient advice.  After doing a bit of research, I decided that I had to stop drinking coffee and black tea and find a beverage that contained ginger.<br /><br />I discovered this tea at my local supermarket.  After drinking it for about a week, I noticed that my digestive system improved dramatically; there was a marked decrease in the burning sensation in my chest and stomach, and no more regurgitation of acid in my throat. As the months went by my problem improved about 90%, which I attribute to modest adjustments to my diet and drinking this tea 3-4 timed a day.  I usually include about a half a teaspoon of sugar and a drop of milk, although I also enjoy it straight up.  It has a pleasant flavor with a bit of a lemon zing.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this product for anyone with an acid reflux problem.  I believe it will help you much more than the over the counter or prescription drugs recommend by doctors.","If You Have Acid Reflux, You Must Drink This Tea!"
"summarize: I was really disappointed when the WalGreens and grocery stores around me stopped carrying these. They have been my favorite lollipops since I was about twelve years old.<br /><br />For those buying blind, let me just clarify once and for all: THESE LOLLIPOPS ARE FLAT! THEY ARE NOT ROUNDED LIKE A TOOTSIE POP OR A DUM-DUM.<br /><br />The actual hard candy part of the lollipop is a delicious granny smith apple flavor unlike any other candy out there, with a very satisfying, crisp tartness. On the outside, the Tootsie Roll company has slopped a generous spoonful of sweet caramel, and yes, this does tend to make the shape of the lollipop undulate a little bit. The shape of one pop isn't going to be consistent to the next.<br /><br />If that bothers you, well... I'll be honest, I find that a really weird thing to hold against a lollipop.

"summarize: Barry Farms is known for their quality and rare, hard-to-find ingredients. Xanthan Gum is no exception, but anything can be found on Amazon, right? Barry Farms to the rescue!<br /><br />Xanthan Gum is used to modify the viscosity of liquids, on a very low scale (typically 1/3 tsp per 1 gallon). Because of the difficulty in combining Xanthan Gum to a liquid evenly, you should mix this into your liquid very slowly, in a blender at full speed, and it should be one of your steps (before adding other ingredients, including Guar Gum).<br /><br />Many ice creams and popsicles, even Italian ices, call for two main ingredients: Xanthan Gum and sometimes Guar Gum (also available from Barry Farms: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00015UC5M?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8). Both of these gums behave quite differently, and Xanthan Gum can be harder to mix into your liquid solution (again, mix in slowly via blender running on high), but both are effective means to preventing crystallization of liquids, which is the secret to making softer ice cream and popsicles instead of rock hard ice!<br /><br />Another interesting characteristic of Xanthan Gum is its ability to thin out when subjected to forces such as shaking (called shearing), which makes it great for poured sauces, as it will thicken back up after having exited the bottle. It can also prevent oils from separating from liquid-oil emulsions (think salad dressing). It is also more stable under a wider range of temperatures and pH than other gums.<br /><br />Xanthan Gum can also be used to give dough the stickiness that is needed in gluten-free baking, as gluten is usually what gives that sticky characteristic to dough. And no matter the use, Xanthan Gum will always remain colorless and flavorless, so it can be used for just about any need that suits it.",Perfect for Popsicles and Italian Ices
summarize: I am not a huge coffee drinker but I need some caffeine every once and a while. This is alright. It does taste like hot chocolate but on the largest cup setting it tastes like chocolate water. The middle setting is alright but I feel it tastes the best on the smallest cup size. Sometime I will mix 2 of the small cups together to get a decent size drink. I am a fan of the Cafe Escapes line as they taste very good and don't make a mess while making.

"summarize: I love this blend of tea--I've been drinking it since it came on the market (back in the old days when the packages were psychedelic and quirky, and Red Zinger had almost 20 different herbal ingredients--now sadly reduced to a much less complex blend.) However, Sleepytime may have changed its package but the blend is the same--lime blossom (linden flowers or tilia, same thing), chamomile and spearmint. This is a brilliant mix, the linden and chamomile floral, sweet and soporific, the spearmint adding just enough of a hit to make it interesting. It's good as an after-dinner digestif, or as a before-bed soothing drink.<br /><br />Each ingredient has a purpose; linden is a relaxer and is said to restore the liver (hence, it's used as a tisane in France, where livers are always suspected of being upset), chamomile is a tension-tamer and soothes the stomach, and spearmint is a digestive (unless you have GERD--mints can be irritating, sad to say.) After a heavy meal, this tea can soothe a stomach. As a before-bed potion, it's unparalleled. I drink this almost every evening. You can serve it to children with a bit of milk and sugar to make ""cambric tea"" which is an old recipe for a posset to serve to children, too young for caffeine. (Cambric is a white, sheer fabric, so ""cambric tea"" is white and thin, no color.)<br /><br />You actually don't need to have K-cups--just brew a cup of hot water from the Keurig and dip in a Sleepytime tea bag. But if you are serving guests at table or in your office, a dripping tea bag is a nuisance and I for one am not a person who drinks her tea with the bag sitting in the mug. I just can't do it, though I know many people do. Call me a fussbudget but I don't like sipping past a steeping bag. The K-Cup makes a perfectly steeped cup immediately and no messy bag to clean up. So if you drink this on the way to work in a travel mug or don't want to deal with a tea bag, the K-Cup is very  nice indeed.",My favorite blend from Celestial Seasonings in K-Cups for convenience

It's a berry that has extremely high amounts of Vit C.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the drink.  When I ordered this item I was expecting a carbonated ""orange tangerine"" drink, but that was not the taste I got.  After all, tangerine and orange are present in smaller amounts than grape and apple juices.  As a result this drink had a flavor more like a mixture of sparkling grape and sparking apple combined, with somewhat of a light citrus twist, but less carbonation than either sparkling grape or sparkling apple have.<br /><br />The overall flavor of ""Switch"" was all right, but it was not, in my opinion ""orange tangerine"" at all.  In that respect this drink was a great disappointment.  The manufacturer would have been more accurate to name this drink ""fruit punch"" or ""fruit cocktail"" or perhaps ""grape-apple"".  There is, by the way, already a ""fruit punch"" version...I wonder what's in that flavor that's not in this one?<br /><br />The can size is just adequate at 8.3 oz, but is, I would say, fairly expensive at nearly $1/can, especially when it's not what you thought you were getting.<br /><br />The drink does, to its credit, have 100% of the recommended daily amount of Vit C, and has only natural juices in it.  That is probably true, but...THIS IS NOT A DIET DRINK.  Just because the can says ""no sugar added"", that doesn't mean that there's no sugar in it.  There happens to be a significant amount of sugar in this drink (given the total volume you get/can)...if I recall correctly the contents label said 35g of sugar.  That's because 100% fruit juice is loaded with sugar, sugar like fructose.<br /><br />OK, frankly, the taste combo doesn't particularly appeal to me, that's why I didn't order the grape version of this product, and now that I know what's in the ""orange tangerine"" I wouldn't order it again.<br /><br />I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars though, simply because it's not really an orange-tangerine drink as advertized.  I guess I'll have to go with 2 stars.  (I don't know why 3 stars showed up for this product!?)  Alas...","Switch ""Orange Tangerine"" is misnamed...and perhaps a bit overpriced, and NOT A DIET DRINK!"
"summarize: These packages contain less than the ones I have bought at CostCo for several years and cost more, by the time you figure S/H.  Our store no longer carries them so I was happy to find them on Amazon.  The order arrived and I was shocked to find notice on the outside cartons that they are NOT a product of USA.  True, that info is in tiny font at the bottom of the printing on back of the packages but I had never noticed. I will not be buying these again and will read labels much more carefully in the future.",Country of origin is news to me
"summarize: So far i am in love! It tastes normal, not like those artifical sweeteners do.  and i don't have that pooky-yucko breath that sugar or honey gives you. also my mouth feels nice & clean.<br /><br />the coolest thing is i noticed my throat is clearing & my congested sinuses are loosening up a lot (i usually have a lot of sinus congestion every day. bad allergies & eating lots of sugar contribute to that) I first noticed i was sneezing a few times, then i noticed that my throat was clearing up. i chewed the gum again & noticed MORE of this effect. It's amazing! so i hopped online & did more research on xyltol & read that it is used as a nasal wash & to clear up ear infections. I believe it after how i feel jsut chewing some xylitol based gum & drinking one cup of tea sweetened with a teaspoon of it i see a HUGE inprovement. I am so delighted!<br /><br />i just used this for the first time tonight so i hesitate to give a 5 star rating as i need to give it more time. I want to make sure it doesn't make me feel funny or that there are no bad side effects.<br /><br />but so far so good!","tastes good in my tea, no icky breath after drinking, sinuses clearing up"
"summarize: A few weeks ago I picked up a couple noodle bowls that I can keep in the pantry for occasional lunches or things like that. One was the Nongshim Bowl Noodle Soup Hot and Spicy (Beef Flavor). It's real easy to prepare and I just follow the simple instructions. I use the microwave method and it's ready in a matter of minutes, The flavor is good. It's spicy, but not overly so. Strangely, although it doesn't seem overly spicy to the taste, if I inhale the fumes it irritates my nasal passages somewhat. I have had to learn to eat it without inhaling. The sodium is high so I don't like to have things like this very often and I'm careful of sodium the remainder of the day. The protein content is too low for a complete meal, so I add a few protein items. Today, I added a couple pieces of beef jerky. All in all, I'd say it's one of the better beef-flavored bowls I can remember. It's good to have a few handy things like this around but I wouldn't want them to become a major part of my diet..<br /><br />Gary Peterson",Handy. Tasty. High On Sodium. Low On Protein.
"summarize: I received a box with a package of these tasty Oreos - they are chocolate-like coated, with a peanut butter creme filling, and the usual Oreo cookie for the bottom. When I pulled the package of Oreos out of the box, it looked strange. Unfortunately through delivery, sitting in a hot UPS truck/ other, these things melt and change position in their little plastic slots. I immediately put the Oreos in the refrigerator, just on a hunch. It's not even hot yet here in South Texas, it was maybe 80 degrees yesterday. After these cookies had been in the fridge for a few hours, I pulled back the front of the package and saw what happened to my treats! All of them were melted and stuck to other cookies, etc., it was a mess. I shudder to think of what these cookies would look like if it were the usual temperature around here.<br /><br />As far as how these cookies taste, yes they are yummy. They are also very messy, even if they weren't all melted and re-solidified.  I am not a huge fan of Black Oreo crumbs all over my flooring.  I felt like I had eaten something similar to it before, but still can't quite put my finger on it. These things are way too easy to eat, kinda like Girl Scout Thin Mints. Before you know it, half the package will be gone. Definitely not good at this time of year if you are trying to figure out how to shed some of those extra winter pounds.<br /><br />I stopped by Walmart today and saw these very cookies on the shelf there for under $3. My advice has to be to get them at a brick & mortar store if you want your cookies to be in any kind of condition to eat.","Tasty, but probably not something to order via Amazon"
"summarize: I've used brining bags before so when I saw a good price on this 6 pack I thought I was doing myself a favor. I was dead wrong. Thanksgiving eve I went to turn my turkey over and the top opened up completely from the slightest movement. I had turkey brine spilling out into the fridge and all over the floor. Not something I needed to deal with when I was trying to get my pies baked and the table set.<br /><br />If I weren't a pregnant working mom of a toddler I would return these, but I think I will pass them on to some frenemies instead.",Awful - zip top is too weak
"summarize: Our family eats a fair amount of chicken, and most of it is either grilled or baked. When we bake it, we typically use a Shake 'N Bake mix with it or something similar. Prior to using this product I requested from amazon Vine, however, we had never used a Shake 'N Bake product with pork. In all honesty, I absolutely love pork, whether it be pork loin, bacon, baked ham, deli ham, pork sausage, shredded BBQ pork, pork ribs - whatever. It's my favorite meat, bar none. Why I never thought to try something like this before surprises even me. Maybe it's because pork doesn't need a lot of help to taste good. Unless I'm eating BBQ pork, I don't like to put a whole lot of ""stuff"" on the meat, because I like the natural flavor of it. Fortunately, this mix adds just a bit of zest without drowning out the natural flavor of the pork (in this case, it was pork chops I was fixing). I liked it well enough to try it again, and my kids thought it was good enough to eat again, too. Not fantastic, but a good thing to try once in a while.",As good as I've come to expect from other Shake 'N Bake products...
"summarize: Ummm.. I open the pop top can -- then I eat one or two chunks -- then I drink the pineapple juice and sloowly finish off the rest of the delectable chunks. Yes I am eating right out of the can -- very informally - and there is usually an opened can of chicken chunks next to me at my hidden cubicle at work where I eat my lunch. Chicken and pineapple -- to me, a great informal lunch. Of course when I am home, everything gets mixed in a pot, with cooked white rice and heated to perfection. Or maybe the Dole Pineapple Chunks are slated for a cake, upside-down or right-side up -- Everything (almost everything, maybe not liverwurst) goes better with Dole Pineapple. They are always, fresh, juicy, and tasty.",What's not to love about these juicy morsels??!!
"summarize: In an ideal world, the samples you dispense for your business are the freshest and best version of your product.  After all, people get samples to see if they want to continue buying from you.  In the real world, often sample products are overlooked in favor of high-dollar purchases from repeat customers.<br /><br />Whether this is the case here I couldn't say, but I know for sure the sample pack was full of stale, dusty spices I would never use for cooking.  They were dry, lacking in smell and color, and due to the small sample size were often crushed up leftover bits no self-respecting cook would consider. (Who would use a quarter of a bay leaf?)<br /><br />After further shopping around I ended up finding 'Spices Inc.' and the difference was amazing.  The dill was a dark green instead of a putrid, dusty yellow-green color.  The scent from any one package of spice from there overpowered my entire sampler pack of 12 spices.  I am now pawning off my Spicely sampler pack on someone who just moved and doesn't have any spices.",Hope their regular product is better than the sample pack
"summarize: Buffalo Bills Premium Snacks<br /><br />I realize that taste is an individual thing, but I thought I'd share my thoughts on these products.<br /><br />First, customer service is excellent.  I've always gotten exactly what I ordered in a very timely manner.<br /><br />So far I've ordered the following products:<br /><br />1) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Mild Short Shots<br /><br />2) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short Shots<br /><br />3) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Pepperoni Short Shots<br /><br />The first two short shots are very similar to Slim Jim's, just not individually wrapped, I just put them in a zip lock bag and find them very convenient to munch on( about a quarter pound per bag.<br /><br />4) Buffalo Bills 1.2lb Extra Smokeys<br />These are very smokey, but a little too dry for my taste.<br /><br />5) Buffalo Bills 16oz Premium Hickory Beef Jerky Pieces (random size)<br /><br />Taste great if you are a jerky lover.<br /><br />6) Buffalo Bills 2.1lb Pepperoni  Short Shots<br />Probably the closest to Slim Jim's of all the short shots<br /><br />7) Big Buffalo Ole Smokies<br />Fatter, crisp not as crunchy as short shots, individually wrapped.<br /><br />8) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Honey Strung<br />O.K. taste.  My wife hates the smell.  My Brother doesn't care much for them either.<br /><br />All- in- all, I highly recommend these products (in the order listed) and this company.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2010",Probably the closest to Slim Jim's of all the short shots

"summarize: This conditioner feels different to me than other conditioners.  Let me explain:<br /><br />Cheap conditioners go on slick but rinse off completely and my hair is left a tangled mess.<br /><br />Expensive conditioners (like tresemme or Loreal or Pantene) go on slick and leave a certain amount of slickness in and my hair is way more manageable, but you always wonder about the residue left behind.<br /><br />This conditioner doesn't really go on so slickly, and it washes away completely... and my hair is left somewhere in between the two other examples... not quite so tangled but not totally tangle free.  I have to add detangler when the shower is complete.  (I have very long, fine, curly/wavy hair.)<br /><br />The packaging would seem to indicate this product is more for a scalp treatment and not focused as much on the hair though.  But the conditioner has a nice feel to it and a nice light scent.<br /><br />I still think although I like the no residue feeling that I am so ""conditioned"" pardon the pun to like the slick feeling and no tangles that that is what my preference is even though I don't like the residue in my hair.  It's hard to break old habits.<br /><br />EDIT - I am now down to the last 1/3 of the bottle and I am having difficulty getting the product out.  This is a design flaw of the bottle I think.  The bottle is really thick and hard to squeeze it.  There isn't a good way to take the cap off either.<br /><br />I should note that I also got a bottle of shampoo from the same manufacturer and although this bottle of conditioner did NOT leak in transport - the shampoo did leak.  Something to note if that is a concern.  The leak was not much but it was a hassle to clean up.",Feels different than other conditioners.  Rinses clean.
"summarize: As a low carber, I am always trying to find products which have a ""to die for"" taste and also fit nicely into my diet.  This PB2 with chocolate fills the bill to a T!  It's great for baking...(hint mixed with some coconut flour, eggs, sweetener, etc and you have yourself a lovely peanut butter cookie - low carb style)...and perfect for my protein smoothies.  I make a pitcher of my Peanut Butter Cup smoothie because other members of my family have claimed this to be their fave as well.  Using this PB2 with chocolate, Silk Light chocolate soymilk, ice & water, a little bit of sweetener (I have a serious sweet tooth!), a pinch of salt, chocolate protein powder, and a little bit of real peanut butter, I get about 2 quarts of smoothie for cents per serving!  What's more is it's only 110 calories & 10+ grams of protein per 8 ounces!  That's awesome in my book!",My Fave for Peanut Butter Cup Smoothies!
"summarize: We rescued a momma cat and her kitten.  It took the kitten a full week before she decided we were trustworthy.  Momma is still distrustful and keeps a safe distance.  She's also a finicky eater.  However, these snacks are bringing her around. When they hear the lid pop off the container, both cats come running!  Momma will even get on my lap to eat the snack, which is amazing for her.  I pet her when I feed her, conditioning her to my touch.

"summarize: Bought these based on previous reviews.  I live in CA and dates are plentiful, but I hate shopping so I try to get as much as I can through Amazon. These don't compare at all to what is normally available locally.  Too dry, not all that sweet.  They seem like they've been on the shelf a long, long time and the packaging can't deal with it.  I didn't expect dates like I'd get in Indio, but I certainly won't be buying these again.  I may be spoiled becasuse of where I live, but if I have to spend the same amount of money, I'll just buy them locally and be sure of the quality.","Nice size, but pretty dry and tasteless"
"summarize: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.","Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it"
"summarize: After a week of having them..... Really don't care for this product. My dogs (2 4 year old mixed breed) were not excited about them. The girl had her's for all of about 3-4 minutes, then said thanks but no thanks and walked away. The boy chewed for about 7-8 minutes, then had enough. They stayed on the floor for them to enjoy at anytime, but they rarely have. And when they did chew them - well, I had small hard white pieces all over my rug. Needless to say, can't walk barefoot on the rug.<br />Sorry I made this purchase - especially at the price !

I'm a total choco-phile and I'm always looking for ways to get my fix without the all-consuming waistline guilt.<br /><br />It's not as decadent as what you'll get in a restaurant but then again those babies pack anywhere from 20-50 grams of fat per cake.  Let's not even TALK about the calories!<br /><br />I've tried both the plain chocolate and the mint chocolate version of this product and both are VERY good.  I recommend it for anyone, but particularly for choco-holics who don't want to consume a whole day's fat allowance in one shot! ;)",Almost as good as what you'll get in the restaurant
"summarize: I'd bet that this is pretty good- my dogs thought so! ha!<br />Bought some of this in bulk from the local natural food store, and planned to use it last weekend.<br />I'd not purchased this before, so only purchased ~ 0.5 lb, and was going to make 'meat' balls for spaghetti for dinner.<br />Unfortunately, I had placed the bag in a location accessible to (normally non-foraging) canines. (Am not irresponsible- just didn't think they could reach there!)<br />I arrived home (granted- one hour late from the pups' normal feeding time) and found only a thin plastic bag and the twist tie left, with the bin number written on it.<br />The mix had been COMPLETELY consumed by three medium sized dogs (likely just two, knowing their typical behavior), with only a very light dusting on the carpet left to give a clue as to what had been consumed.  It was a POPULAR find, as they often just don't finish off their 'kills', as the sport alone (conquest/capture) is largely sufficient without complete consumption.<br />A call to the natural food store ('just what was #96?') confirmed that it was this mix, and a websearch confirmed relatively benign contents that did indeed 'pass in the night' (and for the next few days)- and all is well.<br />Would not recommend this method of ascertaining quality/palatability, but am looking forward to my next (SECURE) purchase to try this mix!",Must be good- canine family members ate it before I could! ha!
"summarize: My Mini Aussie does agility training one night a week.  Being that she is an Aussie I am luck to have such a smart dog that has no problems being trained.  However I am also cursed to have a stubborn dog who likes to do things at her own pace and when she feels like it.  The only thing that motivates her are treats, and some treats she likes more than others.<br /><br />The Nathan Hot Dog treats seem to be one of her favorites (believe me she has favorites).  She will always do what is asked for a treat of her favorite snacks from Nathan.  In fact Nathans is one of about 5 treats that we use that she will actually try and steal from our other dog.  Normally she will sit patiently for her treat but Nathans will usually get her to jump up and down.<br /><br />Needless to say we recommend Nathans!!!",My dog likes these best of all
"summarize: I like Taco Bell. That may explain why I really like the taste of this Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce. It is good right from the bottle, two drips per chip, as a corn chip dip. Make nachos with a plate of chips, ladled with ground beef and onion mix, then pour on the Chipotle Sauce. What an appetizer; but unfortunately at the same calorie, fat, sodium, levels as most fancy restaurant dishes, or those huge multi-meat bacon cheese burgers. So for those who do not have to count calories or healthy nutrition, it's tasty. Spicy and flavorful without being HOT, at least to my liking, as I enjoy a bit of heat.<br /><br />If you're not a Mexican fast-food fan, you might find this product a bit unsophisticated. In that case, if the supreme high-priced Tex-Mex restaurants are your cup of tea, then skip this product. But if you want to spice up the celery, carrots and green peppers on your ball game night snack food tray, this may be as good as Taco Bell delivering to your door.<br /><br />Good also as a high calorie taco salad dressing. Unfortunately, I can't tell you if it is good on a taco because I ran the bottle dry before I got to trying it on a real taco.<br />If only they could reproduce the taste with heart healthy nutrition levels.<br />Oh well, I'll bet it's good on a cheeseburger.",Taste is great but Nutrition Facts prove hazzardous

He even goes so far as to plan his shopping and the stops on the trips that he takes, at stores that serve Yuban coffee.

We've asked about his dedication to Yuban coffee to which he replies, ""it's perfect black, but better with something in it!""

"summarize: I handed out the packets to all ages in our house for their opinions.  My reaction was that it tastes like Tang with a fizz, my 12 year old said it was Tang + fresh, ""Can't you taste the green tea at the end?"" he asked.  I could and it does leave a pleasant lingering green tea taste.  My thirteen year old liked it equally well.<br /><br />We used smaller juice size glasses and filled with water and ice.

"summarize: I don't know if most people know this or not, but in Japan we put loose green tea leaves in a pot and just keep pouring hot water over it until the ""taste"" is too weak. All the water must be poured out after no more than 3 minutes or else the tea will be biter. Thats why most Japanese tea sets are so small. Green tea isn't meant to be left in a teapot like english teas. So my first cup of green tea was actually a little stronger than I am used to and I actually got 3 uses out of ONE k-cup. I highly recommend using them more than once if you are making the tea one cup after another....and it will save you MONEY!",USE THE CUPS MORE THAN ONCE!!! EXTRA VALUE!
"summarize: When I first saw this product I thought, great, all natural coconut and shea butter. It's the latest rave and so good for you. This product also smells so deliciously wonderful, like a coconut/pineapple tropical delight! I really like how it feels on my long frizzy hair and makes it so shiney and smooth. Wonderful stuff!!!<br /><br />Once I really looked into the ingredients, I was horrified! I've been really looking at ingredients closely these days and did the same with this product.<br /><br />First ingredient Mineral Oil. Not the greatest stuff since is it a by-product of distillation of gasoline and considered a carcinogenic by some people.<br /><br />Second, HYDROGENATED Coconut Oil. What does that mean? I know coconut oil in it's raw form is really good in our diets and on our skin. After some google research I found out that Hydrogentated Coconut Oil is created by heating to 500-1000 degrees, then a catalyst is injected. The catalyst is typically nickel, platinum, or even aluminum! This stuff is bad for you! It is closer to plastic than a good for you organic compound.<br /><br />Sure, you're not putting it IN YOUR BODY, but there is some absorption that takes place when you squeeze it in your hands and through you scalp.<br /><br />Third ingredient, even worse! Styrene Butadiene Copolymer. Labeled as BHT and most people don't notice this ingredient or even think anything of it. It's Synthetic Rubber used in CAR TIRES, yuck! Embalming fluid, even more yuck! It has been associated to child hyper-activity and cancer.<br /><br />I just can't give this item a good review. It's not even Gluten Free since it has Wheat Germ Oil. Other ingredients are good, like Sweet Almond Oil and Aloe.<br /><br />This product feels really nice in my hair and I will use in on an OCCASSIONAL basis, but not on a daily basis. I have found plain shea butter or coconut oil in raw form is the very best thing for my dry, frizzy hair.","Loved at first, but ingredients are not natural!"
"summarize: I bought the 1.41 oz. package of this seasoning and used two packets with water and a small amount of oil to simmer mussels and clams to serve with paella made with millet, goya yellow rice, peas, sausage, chicken, canned diced tomatoes and other ingredients. This seasoning made a perfect broth.  My first attempt at paella was disappointing, but this perked it up the next day.  If you want an easy way to fix mussels and clams, just add a packet or two of this seasoning to water in a large, wok-style pan.  The mussels and clams will open in the savory broth and you can serve them right from the pan.  Delicious!",Makes a flavorful broth for paella with mussels and clams!
"summarize: After reading all of the dented can reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect. I did get 3 dented cans out of the 12- one was a mild ding, one was fair, and one was such that if I'd been picking it out at the grocery store, I would have looked for a different one- I just ate that one first.  Oddly, they were cans that came from the MIDDLE of the case- so something that happened at the manufacturer- NOT Amazon.  The cardboard tray was unscathed.  ConAgra needs to  do a quality control check on their can dinging area.<br /><br />Anyway, the flavor is pretty good. The first bite wasn't impressive, but since I'm on a fixed income, I only throw away stuff that is about to make me hurl, so I kept eating it.  It got better, and I am glad I got the product.  There were 7 ravioli in the whole can. That is a bit skimpy, but since it was going to be the only thing I had, I ate the whole can and was quite satisfied.  The sauce is much more flavorful than the Chef-Boyardee regular beef ravioli that I had as a kid, and tastes more Italian.<br /><br />The WHOLE can has 480 calories, 10 gms of fat, 78 gms of carbs, and 18 gms of protein.  There are also 10 gms of fiber in the whole can.  The serving size says that  the can is about 2 servings.  Hmm.... maybe for a young kid, or if there was a good salad, and fruit on the side, but I have too much pain to make full meals.  I have to make do.  There are 1 1/2 cups of vegetables per can- so that's good.<br /><br />No preservatives or MSG.  Unfortunately, it probably contains GMO sources of soy and wheat.<br /><br />I originally got these to have on hand for power outages, as I have a gas oven and could heat this up.  The expiration date is for 2 years from now, so that's good.  I can keep them in the pantry for such occasions, but can also see being fine with eating them on days when it's just too hard to come up with anything else.",Pretty good flavor !  Great price !
"summarize: I got these because my local store was out of the capsule size in beef flavor.  I discovered that they work just as well for big capsules, if you use your fingers to press the treat around them.  My dog is very picky and yet he gets the capsule wrapped in this pocket without a problem.  This suits me fine, since the tablet pockets are cheaper.<br /><br />I took one star off because the ingredients are questionable, lots of chemicals, color, corn syrup and other crap.  If my dog were not that old that his comfort is more important to me than his health, I honestly wouldn't go near them.<br /><br />Also, he will not touch the duck flavor, though, but I reviewed this flavor separately.","good for capsules, too - success depends on flavor"
"summarize: Excellent quality of individual whole leaves.<br /><br />For some reason I get jittery from green tea but I love the taste, so a decaf version was just perfect.<br /><br />Mild tasting and given the high quality of the leaves, you are able to just drop a little at the bottom of the mug and fill with hot water and you will be able to drink without fussing with additional accessories.<br /><br />A pound of tea is A LOT of tea, so I'm sure this will last a while.<br /><br />It came in a resealable bag but it wasn't the best quality and broke on the second opening, so I had to find alternative storage for it.","Mild tasting, great quality whole leaves"
"summarize: You would think such a large brand should be trusted; that they made money by making a healthy product for dogs. Well, let me not even say what effects this dog food had on my dog--let me just show the beginning of the ingredients list from the [...] website as of the date of this review (Check there yourself if you don't trust me):<br /><br />Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, sorbitol<br /><br />Corn and corn gluten and rice flour are not exactly wonderful, but--SUGAR and SORBITOL! Sorbitol, that nasty stuff in gum that gives people gas and loose stools! Can you wonder why your dog stinks up the house if it's eating this crap? And sugar! Need I even say why that is bad, or what health problems that can lead to? My vet sure got on a soapbox over the dangers of sugar, and rightly so. And even the ""healthy weight"" stuff has sugar and sorbitol in it!<br /><br />Don't buy Beneful for your dog. Pay careful attention to the entire ingredients list of the dog food you DO buy, as a lot of brands sure don't think you care about whether your dog lives many years or has expensive vet bills as long as it scarfs down their corner-cutting product. And if you must buy Beneful, at least send the company a few angry letters telling them to take the sugar and fake sweeteners out so you no longer have to feel you're killing your dog. I mean, come on, they could use apple juice if they wanted a sweetener. This is incredibly unhealthy and reprehensible, if you ask me. I sure won't buy this dog food ever again, and I would think twice before trusting Purina.",Healthy as a box of chocolates for your dog.
"summarize: I like rich, dark, bold coffee.  After giving up my K-cup machine to go back to a traditional brewer, I was looking for a dark roast that could match my bold k-cups. I drink a lot of coffee, so I wanted to find something more reasonably priced than the ""name"" brands.  I saw a posting on another site for a deal on this coffee and figured I'd check out the reviews. Most were good, and the price was pretty fantastic so I decided to give it a try. Wow! I am so impressed.  Smooth, delicious, bold flavor.  I've been drinking coffee forever, and managed an upscale coffee shop for 2 years, and I truly love this roast. I think it's comparable to the pricey brands for sure.  Seriously, can't recommend it enough.",Delicious dark coffee for unbeatable price
"summarize: I thought is would be a great way to try a variety of teas.  The main disappoint I have is that the number one tea that I was wanting to try from this purchase was the Indian Spice Chai Tea, but there was none in the package I received.  The packaging was quite unexpected - a brown paper bag with a computer printed black and white label.  The individual k-cups are intact, so I do not question the contents of them; I just unprepared for a brown paper bag.  I think my husband and I will enjoy try the different tea varieties, none-the-less.",Disappointed that the Indian Spice Chai Tea is missing
"summarize: I have never seen the silver dutch cocoa - when I found this cocoa I bought it at Wal Mart and found it has a recipe for chocolate mousse on the back!  I haven't served it to anyone that didn't like it.  I made it for the church's thanksgiving dinner. I made some with cane sugar and some with splenda - it was a hit!  Instead of using the 2 cups of whipping cream, I use 1 cup of whipping cream and 1 cup of 1/2 n 1/2 and it turns out great.  I get 4 oz plastic containers w/ lids and that is what I put it in. - for a real treat - freeze the cane sugar ones and it is like a fudge cycle.  Oh yea- when I make my cheese cake I make some mousse with the 2 cups of whipping cream (b/c it is thicker to begin with) and pour a layer over the cake, refridgerate it - cut it and serve it! The last time I went to Wal Mart to buy it - they didn't have it so I went to Winn Dixie - then I found where I could order it from Amazon - I signed up for a regular shipment - there was no shipping for 6.  Comparable to the grocery stores","Makes the best mousse recipe on the back! To lighten the calorie load, I use 1/2 cream and 1/2  half n half -  sometimes splend"
"summarize: I bought these four small cans because usually powdered milk can be very sensible to humidity. There are other choices, like a huge 4 pounds can, and in the end that can be cheaper. However, I prefer to pay a little bit higher and can 4 small cans, its convenient ... unless you have 5 children.<br /><br />Well going to the product: this is is powdered milk made un Mexico. The taste is really good, for sure much better than any 2% fat milk that you can buy in the supermarket. How does it compare to the taste of 4% fat fresh milk (say for instance Horizon, Or Archer farms)? Well I say that the flavor is the same, parhaps the powdered milk has even better taste since it feels a little bit creamier. However, you have to understand that how creamier it feels dependend on respecting the suggested proportion (4 tablespoons per 236 cubic centimeters).<br /><br />For me the taste is GREAT. Also the preparation is really good, my recomendation is to buy some Shaking glass or use and Hydratation bottle to shake the mix and you will get perfectly homogeneous milk. I use and hydratation bottle at work to prepare my milk, eventually mix it with powdered smoothies like Vega Whole Food Shake.<br /><br />Summarizing: its a really convenient product, tastes like fresh milk (or better), it mixes very well with cold water, the price/liter is very competitive compared to good brands of milk (e.g. Horizon) and you don't need a fridge. The only precaution you should know is that powdered milk is very sensible to humidity and fungus, so I recommend good storage, ALWAYS USE AN ABSOLUTELY DRY SCOOP so that you don't introduce humidity into the can.","Good taste, good mixability, good value in general, just be careful with humidity"
"summarize: Water with a Ph of 9.5 is thought to help with many physical ailments (Google it) as well as hydrate better, especially after strenuous activity. I've never seen much of a difference using sports drinks vs cold water, but many people do. This drink would be a much cheaper alternative to those $1 and $2 sports drinks. It does have a different ""texture"" than regular water, perhaps because of the Ph level.<br /><br />There is no source specified, so I assume it's from tap water.  The source does not really matter to me. Many of the springs in this country are becoming contaminated, and those that draw water from ""mountain streams"" - eeewww!  Animals and people use those as a bathroom, and things die and rot there.  The bottom line is that ALL water get filtered thoroughly, no matter the source, and it all starts in the same place.  That's personal preference, but I'm not paying a premium for ""spring"" water that's going to be filtered anyway!","Hey, it's H20 with a twist"
"summarize: I was looking forward to these. The shipment got lost in the mail and arrived three weeks late, however, from inspecting the cookies inside they were not damaged at all. The cookies have a very VERY good gingery taste without any after-taste of chemistry. Organic as homemade, just as you want from Newman's Own. They are riddled with chunks of candied ginger, too, to amplify the flavor. Flavor is top notch.  A ginger-snap is supposed to be crispy... BUT... these are hard-cooked to dog-biscuit consistency, over-browned on the bottom and tooth-breaking solid. Would not purchase again, unless I run into a few in the bottom of the bag not so dark and hard.","not crispy, hard as a rock"
"summarize: When I was very young I tried using this exceedingly dry cheese to make a sauce and I don't advise it.  As I recall, it never did blend in smoothly and the result was rather grainy.

Kraft Parmesan Cheese has it's place in the kitchen.  Not so much as a source of Alfredo sauce, but rather as a condiment.<br /><br />Reasonably priced.

"summarize: The packaging was so beautiful, all color coordinating, high color graphics, very artistically created and arranged. They were all designed with the feel of old world European elegance.  (Perhaps the color palette and design motifs from the era of what we associate with Marie Antoinette.)  All the cookies in the assortment were fantastically delicious.  We gobbled through them all in two days.  (most were petite size in packages with 2 servings each approx.) These were more what I would call European biscuit type cookies that you might find enjoyable with afternoon tea (ie. more like shortbread cookies, nibbly, not chewy, and not overly sweet - how refreshing!).  These cookies were all very fresh, made with very high quality ingredients, and a true pleasure to enjoy.  I would highly recommend this gift basket to anyone.  The entire thing was delivered well wrapped and not one cookie was broken on the inside.  The basket was made of very high quality and can be reused as a fruit basket or a bread basket etc.  I can't say enough good things about this gift basket of cookies.","Really really delicious, gorgeous packaging, awesome gift idea"

"summarize: The good folks at ""Back to NATURE"" have put together an absolutely scrumptious granola offering.  It's so good that you can sit there with the open bag and snack on it handful after handful.  The granola is heavily punctuated with chunks of real dark chocolate.<br /><br />I wanted to try more of this before it was gone, but before I knew it my family had discovered and devoured the entire bag...and that's a good sign!<br /><br />I could also see adding nuts, perhaps almonds or cashews, maybe some M&Ms, and before you know it you'll have a super-fantastic trail mix...good for hiking or camping.

"summarize: Two miniature Australian shepherds, accustomed to very good food, found the Purina Beneful as tasty as their occasional treats and cleared their bowls quickly every time they were given it. There appeared to be no digestive issues, and they were satisfied with the usual size serving.<br /><br />That said, I can't in good conscience give this more than three stars. Reviewing the ingredients list and comparing it to other dog foods on the store shelves, this seems  over-priced for the quality of nutrition it provides. Still too many corn byproducts and other pretty non-dog kinds in its make up to want to buy it on a regular basis.<br /><br />On the other hand, it was cheaper than a lot of doggy treats that are not very nutritious either. Maybe buying a small bag and using it as a treat source while training a puppy could be a relatively inexpensive way to go and wouldn't throw off the overall nutritive value of the dog's overall diet.","Dogs love it, but not an impressive ingredients list"

But this new dry food is a great addition with thick, tasty chunks and nutritious ingredients.  The combination of veggies and meat make for a well balanced meal.  We don't add water to make it juicy since our dog loves sinking her teeth into the crunchy pieces, but for an occasional variation the added water mixes a nice soupy texture.  One thing I particularly like is that the food doesn't stink really badly like other commercially prepared pet foods.  An affordable, healthy choice for your pup.",A pet favorite in our home
"summarize: Rather than just eat chips for a snack I love the Blue Diamond Almond snacks.  This is one of my favorite flavors and the only problem is that they are hard to stop eating.  They have a nice rich smoky flavor and the jalapeno is just enough of a spicy kick to make these almonds taste better.<br /><br />The nice thing about this treat is that they have only 1 gram of sugar while giving you 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.  They are a healthy snack and you get Vitamin E, magnesium and calcium in every serving.  This particular flavor does have 180 mg of Sodium (7% of a daily 2000 calories diet) per serving but they really taste good!

"summarize: For years I wondered what the sauce was that is served with the traditional Peking Duck meals as restaurants, since it was the definitely the star ingredient in the dish. At every restaurant I have ever ordered Peking Duck at, they described the sauce as ""plum sauce"". However when you buy plum sauce, you find it has a very different taste than the sauce used in the meal. So I was never able to put together what it was that was served with Peking Duck. Finally one day I was making a different dish at home that called for Hoisin sauce, which I had never used before. After tasting it, I was thrilled to find that this was that mystery sauce used in Peking Duck. So now I can enjoy my favorite meal at home any time, since I just substitute the duck in the dish with chicken.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the sauce, it's a sweet Asian barbecue sauce.

"summarize: This was the flavor most people preferred when I shared these Fruit Thins in the Office and the response was 45% YUCK, 40% GOOD, and 15% Neutral.  The Yuck group complained that the cracker was too dry, fruit tasted like cough syrup, texture was too chewy.  The Good group like that this was at least nutrious compared to similar crackers and tasted like newtons.  I fell into the neutral group and my main opinion is that it is okay, this type of cracker has been done before, some have had baked better versions and the price is quite expensive for a bag of crackers.  One of the more colorful comments is that NEWTON'S are always characterized by a soft fruit filled cake and this product just does not come close to that description hence the comfort food factor which might have made this more acceptable is lost.  Good effort, bad execution.","Da Better Flavor, but still I've eaten better"
"summarize: I have longish hair which goes wild with summer humidity and which gets sort of dry from pool chlorine, so I was interested to see what 'Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner' could do for me.<br /><br />I have to say that it's a rough equivalent of Pantene conditioner in thickness and how it goes on and rinses out.  Even afterwards I can't say that I could tell the difference in how my hair looked and felt as compared to Pantene.  And I'd probably buy one or the other interchangeably based on price.<br /><br />I would like to note though that if you have long crazy hair like mine that you might want to try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8T8"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Conditioner</a> instead.

Some of Sprout's other flavors were big bust, but this one is a winner.  We shake a little sea-salt on it, as it is very low sodium, and the flavors really come out.

"summarize: Like some of the other reviewers, I did a lot of research before deciding on this food. (Want your eyes opened? Read ""7 Scary Things You Didn't Know about Your Pet's Food."" But if you're reading about this product, you probably are already aware of the low quality of grocery store cat foods.) My cat is a dry food addict and though I've tried every (healthy) suggestion out there, I cannot convince him that wet food is anything other than a snack. So I decided to at least feed him the healthiest dry food that I can afford rather than Meow Mix.<br /><br />There are some better dry cat foods, but they are only a little bit better and they're a lot more expensive. Some of them cost $10 a pound. At that price, I'd be better off feeding my cat from the meat department at the grocery store. Free range, organic chicken doesn't even cost $10 a pound. (Amusingly I just spotted where Amazon.com claims a list price for the 6 pound bag of the Chicken Soup Cat Senior as $149.49. That's $24.92 a pound!! You could feed your cat steak for less than that.)<br /><br />This is a high quality cat food with an ingredient list to put a smile on your face. For what you're getting, the price is reasonable though it's still more than the Meow Mix. The product is not carried locally. So I was happy when I found it on Amazon.com, as since this item qualifies for free shipping, that is what makes it affordable to me. (If I had to pay the over $14 shipping on it, I'd be better off going to the pet store and buying Blue Buffalo at $2.29 a pound. With the free shipping the Chicken Soup is $1.57 a pound. Without the free shipping it's $2.36 a pound.)<br /><br />Those were my reasons for choosing Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul from Amazon.com.<br /><br />Now how did my Meow Mix loving cat feel about it? When I opened the door and carried in the first box, my cat immediately started rubbing up against it and acting all excited. I had had this plan to slowly transition the cat by mixing it with the Meow Mix. But he was so enthusiastic just at the smell that I immediately opened the box, cut open the bag and offered him a handful. He dove right in. He absolutely loved it! (Now I was bit taken aback. I was so used to multi-shape, multi-color cat food. This food has no dyes. All the kibbles are the same X-shape and they're all brown.)<br /><br />I never did finish that last bag of Meow Mix. I just started putting 100% Chicken Soup in the bowl. I just ordered his third bag and he still loves it every single day.<br /><br />The cat used to throw-up the Meow Mix every so often. But I haven't seen him vomit up the Chicken Soup at all. So apparently it agrees with him better. I haven't noticed any kind of stool problem. (But to be fair, the cat didn't have diarrhea on the Meow Mix either.)<br /><br />I feed him the same amount as I did the Meow Mix: half a cup a day. I'd read that you could cut down serving size on premium foods, so I tried feeding less (also hoping it would cause him to eat more wet food) and all I ended up with was a skinny, underweight cat. So I went back to the half cup a day and the cat's back up to a healthy weight.<br /><br />The one caution I would tell you is this food is not made with artificial preservatives. I buy the big bag because it's more economical (and qualifies for the free shipping), but I only have the one cat. It takes him about 4 - 5 months to finish an 18 pound bag. (Let's see. I ordered my first bag in February. It's the end of October and he's finishing up his second bag. So, yeah, that's 4.5 months a bag.) It means the food is going to sit around for a while. So I take precautions to keep it fresh. I have a small container that I used to feed him daily; it holds about 3 weeks of food. The bulk of the food I store in a large air-tight container with a paper towel over the top of the food. Then when the small container is empty, I refill it from the large container. This keeps the food fresh for the 4 to 5 months no problem.<br /><br />Overall, the cat and I both very pleased with Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul Dry Cat Food for Adult Cat, Chicken Flavor from Amazon.com.<br /><br />EDIT: Typical cat. As if making a mockery of what I wrote, two days after I posted this, I walked into the kitchen to find where the cat threw-up this food. But it's the first time. And, bizarre as it sounds, it gave me a chance to find out something. When the cat used to throw-up the Meow Mix it always looked exactly like when it came out of the bag --- hadn't been digested at all. This food must be easier to digest because it was already broken down. It took me a minute to figure out what it was as the cat had puked directly under the trash bag and, at first, I thought the cat had torn another hole in the trash bag and something in it had fallen out.<br /><br />EDIT 2-18-12: KIBBLE SHAPE HAS CHANGED! Just opened the latest bag I ordered. It no longer has ""X"" shaped kibble. It's now a teeny-tiny circle, much smaller diameter than the ""X"" had. I admit I'm concerned as it looks small enough that the cat really won't need to chew much, if at all, before swallowing it. And if the cat doesn't chew it, how is it supposed to help keep his teeth clean? However, the cat still loves it. I checked the ingredient list with a previous bag. Found some changes in the smaller ingredients. Methionine is now listed as DL-methionine and the three Lactobacillus ingredients are now listed as dried Lactobacillus fermentation products. All the protein sources, fruits, veggies, etc are still the same and listed in the same order.",Excellent Quality and Value and the Cat Loves It (EDIT -- Kibble Shape Change!)

"summarize: Taco Bell's Bold & Creamy Chipotle Sauce is the third of the Taco Bell's Bold & Creamy line we have tried at home, and it is our favorite.  Both my wife and I liked this one the best out of the three.  The other two were the Jalapeno sauce and the spicy ranchero sauce.  We liked all three, but we liked this one a bit more.<br /><br />We actually make tacos at home quite often, and that is when we used this sauce.  However, it could be good on other things too.  It has a good flavor, and if you are like me and order chipotle items off of menus when you are out, you most likely would like this sauce at home as I do.<br /><br />There are 110 calories per 2 Tbsp.  100 of those calories come from the 11g of fat. (Soybean oil is the main ingredient  So this is not a diet condiment, but how many are?  No different than most mayo you get.  If you want less fat, you should use salsa type toppings on your tacos.<br /><br />If you like chipotle flavor, this is a good sauce for your tacos and other foods.  I like it and will get it again.",Good chipotle flavor for your tacos
"summarize: Taco Bell recently introduced a new line of three ""Bold & Creamy"" sauces for the home market. Each is based on soybean oil, water, vinegar, buttermilk,  and a few other standard ingredients. The Bold and Creamy Chipotle Sauce adds chipotle chile pepper puree, chipotle chili pepper, extractives of paprika, and natural smoke flavor to the basic recipe.<br /><br />As with the other two sauces, I tried the Chipotle Sauce first on regular Taco Bell tacos, both crunchy and soft. As with the others, I still prefer a traditional taco sauce on my tacos. It is also a fairly mild sauce to those of us who first experienced Mexican food before there were chain taco places. There is a slight-though-perceptible heat that lingers for maybe a minute if you don't drink or eat something else immediately. There is  a mild smoke flavor, which would be expected given the ingredients.<br /><br />I tried it with some plain tortilla chips. The chipotle and smoke flavors come through clearly when there is little in the way of competing tastes. Still, I'd rather have a traditional chunky salsa with my chips. I can't see myself using this sauce again on tacos, but I do think it might be good on a hamburger or as a dipping sauce for onion rings. I plan to try it on both after the current heat wave has passed. When it's this hot (95º - 105º), I try to avoid any cooking that adds to the heat load the air conditioning is managing. I'll update this review after I've tried these items with the Bold and Creamy Chipotle Sauce.<br /><br />One note: the ""Best if Used By"" date on the bottle I received was only about six weeks after I received it. This seems kind of short to me for a room temperature bottled product that's refrigerated after opening. Perhaps it was from an older lot, but it's something to bear in mind if you're thinking of ordering in bulk or taking advantage of a sale.",Slightly smoky and creamy is more like it
"summarize: Well, I WAY over paid for this on Amazon. $19.99 is what I paid for it. Turns out you can pick this up for half the price at a local hardware store or even a big box store. What a shame. I wanted to believe you can get items on Amazon for cheaper than in stores. BOY, was I wrong!!! Don't bother getting this from Amazon!!!<br /><br />About the product:<br />It works well. Unfortunately, there isn't a list of what you can use it on here, like the 20 different Lily plants I have or my Dicentra(burning heart). Just to name 2. So, be careful what you spray it on. Best to find a list of what you can use it on before buying.","It's not bad, but much cheaper elsewhere"
"summarize: First I brown 2-3 lbs. of cut-up chicken breast (bite-sized pieces) with butter or ghee in a skillet. Then I either set it aside (I usually make both a vegetarian and a meat version at the same time), or add it to a 5-6 quart pot if I am making only the chicken included sauce.<br /><br />I then add a little more butter to the skillet and add two or three chopped bell peppers (I like to use 1 each of green, red and yellow peppers for color), one large white onion (chopped), 3 diced garlic cloves, grated ginger (to taste) and a pound of sliced mushrooms. After they are slightly browned I add them to the pot.<br /><br />I put two jars of Patak Korma Curry Cooking Sauce into the pot with the vegetables and the chicken (if making a vegetarian dish at the same time I finish the sauce, separate some out into a smaller saucepan and then add the meat to the larger pot). I add one can of coconut milk and curry powder to taste (I like the hot powder but not everyone else does).<br /><br />I let it simmer on medium heat without the lid until it thickens a little (5-10 minutes). Then I reduce the heat to low, cover the pot and continue cooking for 20 minutes. I serve it over cooked basmati rice garnished with fresh curry leaves and with some Indian flat bread (naan). This should feed about 6-8 people. Not authentic but wonderful!",Great sauce if you know how to use it
"summarize: If your looking to make quality homemade smoothies, then look no further than Jet Smoothie Mix.  They use these where I used to work (in a dining hall), and they are excellent.  There are no ingredients needed besides the mix, ice, and fresh fruit.  Jet Smoothies do not disappoint.  There are many flavors to choose from and I am writing this here because this review is one of the more memorable flavors.  However, it is worthy to note that my favorite smoothie was Green Apple Strawberry and it used the Green Apple mix with fresh strawberries.  I am sure you could make a wide variety of delicious smoothies with this mix.  It is great for parties or great for cafeterias.  The only problem I see is with the price.  I wish they sold them individually.  I am sure you can make similar smoothies to Jamba's popular ""Strawberries Wild"" flavor if your into that too.",Look no further than Jet Smoothies
"summarize: This ""syrup"" is not very sweet and despite being labelled ""sweetened with splenda"" it has a very small amount as splenda is the last ingredient. The primary sweetner is acsulfame potassium which is nowhere as far as i am concerned. As a general rule if any deception in ingredients or labelling the product should be boycotted. Who wants to buy products from companies that want to deceive you into buying an inferior or cheaply made product. They find it easier to put a token amount of splenda so they can put it on the label and you will think better of the product. I only would buy this if there was no alternative available and it was necessary due to blood sugar level control otherwise pass on it. I hate food companies that lie. Even small lies. It is like a famous brand of shortening on the market that says 0 grams of trans fats on the label but in reality it is 100 percent hydrogenated oil which is trans fat. Even though the entire can is only trans fat they made the serving size so small that it contains less than 1 gram of trans fat so they can put contains 0 grams trans fat on the label to cheat their customers by deception.  Torani sugar free syrup would not sell much if they put sweetened with acsulfame potassium on the front of the bottle instead of splenda. Nuff said.","Not very sweet, splenda is minor ingredient"
"summarize: I've used this for years and it's the best I've found.  I have a seriously black thumb but with Schultz Plant Food, I can actually get things to grow.  I have no problem with over fertilizing or under fertilizing, it works for young plants, old plants, indoor or outdoor plants, flowers or edibles, you can even use it in your Topsy-Turvy.<br /><br />It's concentrated and easy to use(this bottle lasts a LONG time).  I usually mix up a half gallon and water my plants as needed.<br /><br />Best of all, it's safe so if someone (human or pet) accidentally gets a taste of it, there's none of that rushing off the to the ER.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />**Note** Not suitable for Air Ferns",I Killed an Air Fern Once...
"summarize: I have four cats, two of whom were introduced into the household about six months ago. In an attempt to keep everyone happy and healthy when then my 2 new kittens arrived, I had advanced to a more expensive canned food which the kitties are served at their evening meal. Yep! Everyone was fat and sassy. But my Kitty bills were going over the top.<br />Then reality set in. In addition to more wet food, I was purchasing more dry food and more litter AND spending a lot more time cleaning up cat hair. I could afford 4 cats, just not four cats who thought they were living at the Ritz! So, I decided to look through the Fancy Feast line up so that I could find wet food that these spoiled kitties liked but was not priced like Filet Fignon.<br />So I tried Tender Beef and Liver Feast. Yum, Yum. Nobody seemed to notice that their rations were cheaper. What did they know? It just tasted Good!!!<br />All four dived right in and ate. I was very pleased. So, instead of paying over $20 for a 24 pack of 3 oz cans, I was now paying about $14.00. Those savings add up!<br />So here we are...5 happy campers at my house. That includes the 4 kitties and me. I have found several other Fancy Feast Brands which cost little, but are up to snuff in the eating department: There is Beef and Giblets in gravy.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CIFZG"">Fancy Feast Sliced Beef & Giblets Feast in Gravy Canned Cat Food</a> There is a Fancy Feast Trout.Turkey and Giblets took the place of a Turkey and rice mix.(Cats cannot digest carbohydrates anyway.

Of course the fact that I can sign up for Subscribe and Save and do not have to lug the cans home from the store is a huge plus! But Tender Beef and Liver was the first flavor I tried as I started cutting costs, so I just wanted to let everyone know, that it can be done more cheaply while maintaining a happy kitty home. HOORAH. I certainly recommend this!!!",Cats Like Just Fine/Not Too Expensive
"summarize: I really enjoy this coffee! I was skeptical about the packaging, thinking it wouldn't fit correctly in my Keurig, but it did! And for the price, AWESOME! I have used the refillable Kcups, the ones where you can get lids and ""refill"" other cups, but hate it! (I guess I am too lazy to keep refilling and cleaning my kcup) This coffee tastes good too, not the best I have had, but good!

"summarize: When I was in Venice I purchased local red wine to find out what Italians drink at home. It did not taste like anything I had at the large wineries or even the upscale specialty wineries in Napa valley. I sampled the majority of California brands and varietals over a period of a decade in connection with my job. Carlo Rossi is part of Gallo and is a bulk wine. However, the preservation and consistency of the old Italian flavor has been excellent.<br /><br />Pisano is robust and complex but not as dry as burgundy and has no after taste. I find it perks up my taste buds if I have some just before and during a meal. I also use it in Italian red sauces to dampen the sweetness of tomatoes so spices were more pronounced.",More satisfying than the niche brands
"summarize: I consider myself a big fan of both Reese's and Whoppers so I was excited when I saw this new product.  However, after going through one box over a few days, I find this to be a major disappointment.  The product is very waxy and doesn't have enough peanut butter taste (package says ""Peanut Butter Flavored"" which should have been a red flag to begin with).  Maybe this product could be improved if the company 1) adds real peanut butter and 2) tries a double-layer coating of chocolate and peanut butter since this is the winning combination for the famous Reese's peanut butter cups.",Very Disappointing - Room For Improvement?
"summarize: We are on a special diet and there are very few bars that are healthy and have no ingredients that are bad for us.  This is one of them.  This is also incredibly delicious.  My husband, who has a lot of trouble chewing, says these bars are so good he doesn't mind the effort it takes to eat one!<br /><br />I've ordered these twice, but now that hubby has found out how good they are we might be ordering 2 boxes at a time in the future.<br /><br />If you want a quick pick-me-up snack that is healthy and tastes better than most candy, try these!",a bit of heaven in a bar
"summarize: The overall taste of this sauce was a disappointment to me. I love many of this company's products so I was a bit surprised that this chili paste didn't taste any better. There are bitter notes to this sauce which I attribute to chile seeds, vinegar and an excessive amount of salt. Buy some dry red pepper flakes and you'll eliminate the bitterness of this sauce but otherwise replicate it almost perfectly.<br /><br />I much prefer the Huy Fong's Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. It is not only hotter but it has a wonderful sweetness to it combined with some pleasant garlic notes.<br /><br />This is a fine company but not every one of its products hits the mark. This chili paste misses the mark by a wide margin in my view.<br /><br />The product label lists (in this order) chiles (with seeds), salt and then vinegar. The vinegar and salt add a lot of bitterness. As I said - I like this company's products but not this particular one. Salt and vinegar do NOT complement chiles all that well - at least in my limited perspective.",Somewhat Bitter - this company offers better products - I'd pass on this one
"summarize: I got a SodaStream for my birthday.  It comes with a 12 pack syrup sampler with 6 diet syrups and 6 ""regular"" syrups.  I have only tried the diet, caffeine-free syrups.  None of them come close to tasting anything as good as the diet drinks I buy at the grocery store.  Even the store brands taste better than the SodaStream diet drinks.  They remind me of the pre-Nutrasweet sodas that used saccharine as the sweetener.  I use my Soda Stream to make seltzer and it does a great job at that!  I've been experimenting with using drink mixes like Crystal Light, and those work OK.  DISCLAIMER:  I'm one of the folks who get a bad aftertaste with Splenda and Splenda is the sweetener used in the diet SodaStream drink syrups.",Diet drinks taste like diet soda from the old days
"summarize: My sister-in-law is gluten free so I'm always on the look out for products she can eat whenever she comes for a visit. As more and more people are developing gluten sensitivity, it's nice that companies are producing more products that are gluten free. The cereal tasted pretty good. It has a hint of sweetness and vanilla. Honestly, it seemed a little bit like cereal on steroids, there were flakes, rice puffs (think rice crispies), little balls, etc. It kind of seemed like someone went through a cereal bar and just added a scoop of everything and mixed it up in the same box.<br /><br />I'm not sure that I'd buy it again though. Flavor-wise it was decent. It wasn't my favorite, but it wasn't bad. I liked that it's organic and G-free.",A bunch of different cereals in one box
"summarize: I got turned on to Celestial Seasonings teas when I visited the factory in Boulder. I bought a box of this Chai tea and was immediately hooked!  I have bought other Chai ta bags only to throw them away because they were disgusting. This one has just the right mix of seasonings and a hint of vanilla. Like another reviewer said, milk is a must for Chai tea.( I know--I had never put milk in my tea in my life and it sounded gross!) Vanilla soy milk is great and enhances the hint of vanilla in the tea. I also sweeten mine (honey is recommended but I use sweetner). This tea frequently replaces my morning coffee, and the decaf version is just as good if you want it at bedtime. I like it so well that I have ordered it by the case from Celestial Seasonings when I couldn't find it in the store! Kudos to Amazon for carrying it!!",the ONLY Chai teabags worth buying
"summarize: I was worried because some of the reviews stated that the cans came dented. Since I was using this for soap making I wasn't so worried about the look of the cans. Still, I didn't want cans so badly dented that it leched metal into the oil. So I took a little gamble and ordered them. The cans arrived two days earlier than Amazon estimated they would. I opened the box only to find a second box inside. I remembered some of the reviews said that it had been well packaged, so I didn't get my hopes up. I opened this box to reveal mounds of bubble wrap. Finally I got to the cans. Both were pristine! I haven't made the soap yet, but the oil appears to be very nice. It has a light fruity smell and deep green color that I hope translates into the soap!","Fast Shipping, Excellent Packaging, Great Price"
"summarize: I tried different brands, and I find myself buying this one more frequently whenever I can find it at a good price (~6). I use it as a salad dressing instead of vinegar.  Or just add water and drink! I do not have fancy lab instruments to verify authencity ( NMR testing can actually trace the carbon to the poemegrante tree).  The label claims 100% pomegranate.  In my opinion, labels are not always true.  Other brands list, sugar, flavors, ..etc.<br /><br />Compared to other stuff I tried, this is is good.. I have one pomegranate tree in my backyard and I make my own juice whenever I have the fruit.  This taste good but nothing like the real stuff.  This does not mean it is fake however, the high temperature cooking process they use does affect the taste.  Plus there are many varieties of pomegranates out there, some sweet, some tart, some blonde, some red..etc.  If you have access to the real pomegranates, I suggest you make your own, otherwise buy this.  Making pomegrante juice is easy in a blender, but it cost alot to buy the fruit, if you can find it","Not bad, some of the better products out there"
"summarize: I really liked this granola. Yes, as that one dissatisfied reviewer said, You can't see any almonds in there, but really? Did you expect to see whole or half sliced almonds in there?<br /><br />I think the granola tastes good. It tastes crunchy and sweet ( but not overly sweet). I think that sweetness is the honey, and the slight crunchiness is some of the almonds.<br /><br />I use this granola as a topping on my plain yogurt, in my smoothies, and as cereal. I really like to use it as cereal because it fills me up and it tastes ""refreshing"" and it's healthy. I'm a college student, so if I'm short on time I eat the granola as cereal or in a strawberry-banana smoothie.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this granola. Since I ended up loving this granola, I recently bought it again and bought some yeast & bread flour from Bob's Red Mill so I can bake my own bread.<br /><br />I'd recommend potential buyers to try this granola. I did, and I really like it! :)","I guess I'm in the minority here, but"
"summarize: i ordered this and also the medium roast (five pound packages each) and several other types of coffee because i live overseas and i wanted to take a lot of coffee when i went back.<br /><br />anyways, the dark roast is better than the medium roast - medium roast tastes great too but the dark roast is amazing - it is not bitter at all, zero bitterness yet is full dark roast coffee flavored.  it tastes exactly what i imagine the perfect cup of coffee to taste like, without any bitterness, without any funky junk adulterating the taste of coffee.  it tastes SO GOOD i am not kidding.<br /><br />thank you amazon for the great deal on the 5-pound package for $145 free shipping (that works out to about $30 per pound - quite expensive, but for coffee this good it is worth every penny.<br /><br />having said what i just said, there is a third party retailer ive complained about previously - Taj 4 U - who is trying to sell the same exact product (the dark roast 5 pounds) for  $175.45 + $25.99 shipping.  this is no joke - he is charging about $56 more than what amazon charges for the exact same product.  why does amazon allow that? that is just disgusting. I changed my mind about buying this other coffee (Indonesian Sulawesi coffee) because amazon stopped selling and Taj 4 u was sellign the same product for much higher price.  Amazon, please do something about it if you can. thanks.","this is the best coffee ive ever had, hands down, no exaggerating it tastes SO GOOD"
"summarize: I like orange flavor that is why I prefer this new Citrusmint from Orbit. Just like other chewing gums, I have to open two everytime. One seems like too small that I almost don't feel it in my mouth. Orbit is a premium gum at a premium price. Generally I find it more expensive that the others at the aisle. But the flavor and taste lasts for a long time before it is time to throw it out. What more, it cleans your teeth. No calorie and no sugar.<br /><br />Orbit is the first sugar free chewing gum by Wrigley, the make of ""Juicy Fruit"". Believe it or not, Orbit gum was launched in 1944 during the war.<br />It was granted by the American Dental Association of a seal of approval to help improve dental health. It is 1 of the top 5 brands of gum in the United States.",Premium Gum - Good For Your teeth
"summarize: This is the second green tea drink stick blend I have tried from Lipton, the first being the ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007QH41OG"">Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Strawberry Acai, 10-Count (1 Box)</a>"".  Mango Pineapple Green Tea is the flavor mixture in question.  I must say that the taste is really good and all the key ingredients shine through.  In other words, I can taste green tea, mango, pineapple and even a touch of honey, yet none of the flavors are too over bearing.<br /><br />These drink sticks (10 in a box) are 5 calories a serving and taste like they are much higher in calories. It took me a little extra effort to mix the powder into the water, but nevertheless the powder dissolved.  I must say there is a slight, slight aftertaste.  It isn't bad per se but it is worth noting.  I didn't find it to be a big deal or would prevent me from purchasing in the future, yet it should be noted.<br /><br />I believe that Lipton has stepped their game up with these drink mixes and I love the idea that green tea is being utilized.  Green tea is underrated so it is nice that it is being promoted more.","A nice, smooth drink.  Very refreshing"

"summarize: I really like this Zico flavor and was shocked to see so many bad reviews.  Taste is subjective though, so to each his own.  I like how it has a mild citrus taste without any bitterness, I did not find it sour -- maybe I just got a good batch? It is delicious mixed with 4 ounces of orange juice!<br /><br />Other things I like are gin and tonics, crystal geyser lime flavored unsweetened seltzer, real margaritas, and just a slice of lemon in ice water; I felt this coconut water did not taste like any of these in particular, but was in the same family with these flavors.<br /><br />Since this is a love or hate flavor, I suggest buying one from a store and trying it out before investing in a case.",I guess taste really is subjective
"summarize: I stopped drinking coffee years ago, but recently decided that a dose of caffeine wouldn't be a bad idea.<br /><br />  Since I only want a cup or two a day, I looked for a simple way to get it done.<br /><br />  The Folger's single servings are great.<br /><br />  Each bag brews an excellent cup of aromatic, flavorful coffee. Just microwave a cup of water, dunk the bag for however long you like and you've got your cup of coffee. I find that 30 - 45 seconds of dunking gives me what I want.<br /><br />  I tried a generic brand from the local store - and it was pretty bad. Weak, little taste and lots of oil on the surface.

"summarize: First off - this is not an ""instant' product the way most americans expect Hot Cocoa products to be.  It comes in cakes and must be ground either with a mortar & pestle or in a very sturdy grinder/blender.  It is a basic recipe which suits the majority.  Therefore, if you want it to be super spicy, you need to dress it up a bit.  Follow the package instructions for best results but use a whisk.  It needs to be made in a saucepan on top of the stove or in a Mr. Coffee Cocomotion machine.<br /><br />Grind the cakes in advance for maximum convenience and use 1 and a half times the recommended amount for best results. Use whole milk for best results or 2%.  Skim milk just doesn't work as well. For a spicier mug of cocoa, add ground chili powder to taste.  You can also add a piece of vanilla bean while cooking if you like that.  If you want even more cinnamon taste, you can cook with a cinnamon stick. You can add espresso powder as well for a nice change of pace.

"summarize: I have been using Nordic Naturals products for years, way before I got pregnant with my son - so when it was time to choose a vitamin for him, I went straight to the Nordic Berries.  Unfortunately, the sour coating made them completely unpalatable for our child.  My husband and I have been gobbling them up, but the one who really needs them won't touch them.  I have to wonder why they would put such a strong-tasting coating on a children's vitamin - judging from the reviews, mine is not the only child totally put off by this.<br /><br />Total bummer, since these are the best around as far as manufacturing practices and purity of ingredients.<br />Why, Nordic Naturals??! WHY??!!!",Is the sour coating really necessary?
"summarize: Try this at your own risk.  You will no longer be able to ingest any other brand.  I did some investigation and discovered that the people at Ortiz do a lot before they gently pluck these tasty creatures from the sea.  They hire a team of thousands of deep sea divers to visit the schools of tuna and feed them all sorts of delicious foods (foie gras, flan, various fondue dishes). They also massage the fish daily in a similar manner to Kobe beef. They even provide full medical for each fish and its family (providing the fish has committed to being canned at a later date).  You will taste the love in every bite.",How can all other tuna taste so bad?
"summarize: I like that this dog food has beef chunks and vegetables in it. I know some people are upset about the soy, but I don't see it as an issue with my chihuahua ""Tequila"". Tequila is very picky about his dog food and does not eat hard brown dog food for some reason. With this dog food being multi-colored and having beef pieces I was hoping he would eat all of it.<br /><br />Tequila perked up the second I opened the bag. You could tell that he loved the smell. I gave him one of the beef chunks and he immediately devoured it. I filled his bowl with the food and he excitedly ran over to it and started eating. When I walked into the kitchen later, there were hard brown chunks of food placed everywhere throughout the room. Dang dog! He did eat everything else in the bowl. So, he likes it better than a lot of other dog foods. As far as I know, there is not a dog food on the market that he will eat all of....so it gets four paws up from him. I would buy this food for my pup again.","My Dog Loves The Beef, The Brown Hard Pieces Not So Much"
"summarize: At 40 per cent high quality protein, this is great food for a young, healthy, very active dog. It's hard to find food with that much protein. We've been through the wringer for 3 years with our German Shepherd's food needs. He was diagnosed at 1 year old with IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) and even though he is on medication, we have to be careful because anything less than top quality food will give him terrible diarrhea (no matter how slowly and carefully we transition him from one food to another). Even some top quality foods will do it.Since we put him on Canidae Pure Sea he's had consistently firm stool for the first time in his 3 years of life. His coat has gotten more soft and glossy, his breath is good (for a dog), he's put on and kept on some much-needed weight. We are so happy! He's also a picky eater, but he loves the Canidae and never turns his nose up at it.<br /><br />A couple of notes for any dog-savvy readers: we ruled out EPI and protein sensitivities early on. He's on Tylan and Immodium for the IBD, and most likely will be for life. The vet said that no matter WHAT we do, he will likely be subject to bouts of diarrea. That's why the Canidae seems so miraculous.",Great Food for high energy dog with digestive problems!
"summarize: This is available in many grocery stores too, and is partway between the cheap and fancy teas, price-wise.  The freshness and flavor are top-rank, though. It has all the good points of an afternoon tea: strong enough to easily take milk or cream, a floral topnote that doesn't evaporate in a few minutes, a rich fresh-kilned-wood middle, a dry flat base that isn't bitter, and incredible sustain on the after-taste (great with shortbead, poundcake, etc).  The freshness on my box was great, considering the individual packets let some flavor out. Not watery or wimpy like a Tetley or Bigelow, but not hard or bitter either.  Only St. Dalfour had more top aroma, but it didn't have the nice middle wood this tea has.  This really exceeded my expectations, and I didn't even dump it from the bag to bump flavor.",Excellent afternoon tea with a distinctive flavor
"summarize: I'm embarrassed a bit by how much of this we use since pizza sauce is so easy to make. I have some pretty serious back issues though and can't always cook for my family the way I'd like to.<br />This is just a wonderful thing if you have kids. My children are teens now, and they use this in ramen, omelets, sandwiches and burgers. It's a bit high sodium, but for lunches on weekends I don't mind it. The flavor is not sweet like some pizza and spaghetti sauces can be and the herbs they use to season it work very well. It's an absolutely consistent product.<br />If you're worried about the sodium, after the bottle is partly empty, pour in some plain tomato sauce and shake it up well.<br />My daughter's favorite omelets are made with this, pepperoni, mozzarella cheese and tomatoes. My son loves the same thing but adds mushrooms to his.",Can't beat this for convenience if you have teens
"summarize: I got one box of this from Super Target for about $3.75 for 16.<br /><br />Tea is comparable to Celestial Seasonings Sleepy Time Tea , though the STT Extra has 25 MG valerian, which is likely the strongest relaxing ingredient. The Yogi Tea, however, is far more tasty and I prefer the Yogi tea with a couple tspns of sugar. I researched the ingredients, and all are classic relaxation promoters with a long history of success. I wish they would make it clear how much of each ingredient was in the tea though.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful tasting and effective tea .",Great Tasting W 20mg Valerian and others.
"summarize: I'm feeling extremely foolish as I write this review.  I ordered this wasabi to be forwarded overseas without realizing that if it is ""fresh,"" that means it is shipped refrigerated (with dry ice in a Styrofoam container within a box).  Of course my shipment was no longer cold by the time I received it in Oman - what a waste of good wasabi and a lot of money!

"summarize: I have been eating these since I first tried them on a commercial air line flight at least 20 years ago.  I was thrilled that Amazon still sold them, since all the B&M's have stopped selling them.  But, unfortunatly, all great things must come to an end.  I will not pay $40.00 plus for 6-10oz cans.  I made it through the burnt peanut problem, and love Amazon's service, but at these new prices, I will have to just say no.  It is a shame that such a great product is not sold by local stores any more and that Planters does not push this product harder.","Love them, but have gotten too expensive."
"summarize: A quick look at the reviews of this product shows that people are divided as to whether this is a guilt free pasta dream come true or whether this is a nasty, smelly, slimy nightmare.  And I fall solidly into the ""Dream Come True"" camp.<br /><br />As a person with miltiple food allergies and type 2 diabetes, my diet had become a bland, monotinous string of meat and vegetables.  I don't like ""fake"" food and so I had opted out of substitutes like fake cheese, low carb bread, and artificial sweeteners.  Then I ran across these noodles (my doctor carries a line of low carb foods in his office), and decided that I would try them once, even if I probably wouldn't ever want to eat them again.<br /><br />I am really glad I tried them.  I like the texture, and the taste is so bland that they quickly soak up any flavor that is cooked into them.  The initial odor coming out of the package is kind of ""fishy"", but that goes away quickly as the noodles are prepared and they absorb the flavors and aromas of the foods they are cooked with.  The texture is slippery, stretchy, and chewy - kind of like I remember real pasta being.  Some reviewers said that they didn't like the ""slimy"" texture, but I didn't find it to be any slimier than real pasta.  In any case, it didn't bother me at all<br /><br />I started with spaghetti and meatballs, then I had buttered noodles, and then I had noodles with taco meat and a yummy mexican sauce with olives and avacado.  Then there was my allergen free version of Pad Thai.  The list goes on and on and I have never failed to love whatever I have used them in.  AND my blood sugar stays within the normal range!<br /><br />I tried several shape varieties, and I like the fettuccini noodles the best for pasta because they have substance.  I like the shiratake rice as a rice substitute.  I used the ""fake rice"" for a stuffed zucchini dish that was to die for - my whole family dove in and raved for more!  Shiratake noodles are now a part of my diet and long term lifestyle, and I have enrolled in the Subscribe and Save program because I use them so often.<br /><br />Shiratake noodles are something a person either loves or hates, and there doesn't seem to be much in between, so I recommend that anyone who isn't sure and wants to try it once should buy from the Miracle Noodle website because they accept returns if you don't like the product.  If you like them, you can then purchase from Amazon, but first time users should buy directly from the manufacturer.",It's Great to Have Pasta Again
"summarize: If you want a training treat that will have your dog eager to learn, try cutting these rolls into small chunks.  Given to dogs in small doses for good behavior, you will have them paying rapt attention to whatever you ask of them.

Ezekiel 4:9 bread (which is sold frozen) is also pretty good. But their spaghetti?

And then there's the taste.

"summarize: I'm a muesli eater who tries a granola every once in a while to see if I've changed my mind and decided I like it any better. Like other granolas, this one did not convince me to switch. My basic gripe about granolas is that they get that crunchiness from sugars. That's true here as well, although the sugars have fancier names -- plus you have chocolate added.<br /><br />The ingredients of this product are as follows: whole grain rolled oats, semi-sweet chocolate chunks (chocolate, sugar, dextrose, cocoa butter, etc), evaporated cane juice, brown rice syrup, brown rice flour, expeller pressed safflower oil, molasses, vitamin E (to preserve flavor), natural flavor.<br /><br />I'm not a health nut, but since I really enjoy muesli more anyway, I guess I still don't see much of a reason to switch to granola.

I checked the shipping carton and found that ONE has started getting its coconut water from the Phillipines.  Big mistake.  It's awful. The only way you'd know this is if you buy it by the case.  ONE doesn't identify the source country on individual Tetra Paks. Anyone who started with ONE in the beginning knows they used only Brazilian coconuts as their source.  The original stuff was crisp, clean and totally refreshing.  This new source is murky and not satisfying at all.  Time to look into other brands.

"summarize: I was recently given the top of the line Keurig single cup coffee maker from Costco that came with a lot of different flavors to test out.

"summarize: I am so happy to find this tea--and all of Davidson's bulk teas--on Amazon for such an affordable price.<br /><br />First of all, I have visited tea plantations in South Asia, and out of respect for the workers, I believe very strongly in buying organic teas, not only for my family's health but for the health of workers who would otherwise be getting cancers and all kinds of health problems from spraying the pesticides day after day.<br /><br />At the same time, Fair Trade and organic teas can be much more expensive! but this tea solves the problem.

"summarize: I switch between Kellogg's and Post's respective versions of raisin bran since each has its pluses. Post has the flake portion down pat - large flakes with a nice crunch. In contrast, the Kellogg's flakes are smaller and more fiber-tasting. (As an aside, the Kellogg's flakes work better than Post when using the cereal as an add-in for baking multi-grain breads or oatmeal cookies).<br /><br />But raisins are part of the equation as well. Kellogg's seems to have more raisins and, more importantly, they taste better - plumper and less chewy than the ones in Post.<br /><br />I usually get Kellogg's since I can live with their less than great flakes, and they usually cost less (good sales on Amazon, plus I can get the jumbo boxes at Sam's Club).

"summarize: Cafe Bustelo releases a stale, pungent aroma when the can's seal is broken: you are forewarned by an odor reminiscent of Maxwell House or perhaps Folger's that has been ground together with cigarette butts.  Draw a demitasse of espresso and you can either 1) dissolve the enamel off your teeth by drinking it or 2) water it down to Americano strength where it will merely taunt you, daring you to drink it even when you know you shouldn't.

Yes, it's cheap - but the more important question is: are you?",Is this a can or an ashtray?
"summarize: The wisdom in the old saying, ""compare apples to apples...oranges to oranges,"" etc. applies here. If you compare Skinner's Raisin Bran to other raisin brans, you are comparing apples to oranges, so to speak. Skinner's is made by an entirely different process than any other raisin brans. While I have had to use Post Raisin Bran and some of the organic products when I was unable to find Skinner's, the difference in taste is dramatic. The difference is in the way each is made. Skinner's is made by steaming the whole wheat kernels, rolling them flat and baking them. The common brands of raisin brans are made from wheat flour and other ingredients, and the flour is most commonly ""bleached and enriched"", having been refined by separating the components of the wheat berry and bleaching the endosperm,the major ingredient in bleached wheat flour. Therefore, cereals made with bleached wheat flour lack the bran and most certainly the wheat germ. Those two nutritionally essential components of the wheat berry (the bran and the germ) not only provide the strong flavor, but also all the healthy ingredients provided by ""whole wheat"". Furthermore, it is a well-known fact that only whole grains can be completely metabolized by the body; refined grains less so and tend to be stored rather than fully metabolized.<br /><br />Therefore, for those cereal eaters who are accustomed to raisin bran or other cereals made from wheat flour with flavor enhancers, the Skinner's at first taste may seem strong, mainly because whole wheat has a strong flavor, which could be interpreted as ""bad"" because it is so different from those made with refined flour. Also, because they are made from the whole wheat berry, the Skinner's flakes have a much firmer texture, the advantage of which is that they do not get soggy in milk before you eat the whole serving. My children and grandchildren all prefer Skinner's, either as a breakfast cereal or as muffins or cookies. I am so thankful to be able to get this product from Amazon since it is scarce in the markets in my region. Remember, apples to apples, oranges to oranges....",My 1st choice in raisin bran for 60 years

"summarize: I love coconut water, but every time I try it in the States, there seems to be something missing. I have tried several other brands side by side, and there always seems to be something missing (or they taste like wet socks).<br /><br />SAMU is the only brand I have ever had that seems to embody the refreshing and smooth taste of coconut water brought directly from the plantation. It actually reminds me of drinking coconut water directly from the coconut at a Thai beach resort like Koh Samui - clean, refreshing, and invigorating.<br /><br />The tiniest bit of sweetness sets it so clearly above all other brands, I don't know how I could ever go back to drinking any other coconut water.<br /><br />The other thing I really like about SAMU is the fact it is in an aluminum can. Alot of other coconut waters you will see are in those cardboard-laminate boxes, which are next to impossible to recycle. By putting SAMU in a can, it not only has a familiar hand-feel, but I know I can easily recycle the can as well.<br /><br />Overall, I rate it 5 stars: an excellent product and well worth the money. I highly recommend it.",A DIFFERENT Kind of Coconut Water
"summarize: My husband and I both loved these cookie/crackers, and they didn't last long!  They did seem to be slightly addictive for both of us, but 3 is the serving size, and 3 was enough for my sweet tooth, too.  I didn't think my husband would like them, but I caught him eating them 2 or 3 times.  They didn't taste at all artificial to either of us.  The taste was like a blueberry muffin, but quite crisp.  They ARE thin, but they're also larger than most cookies, which is why 3 was enough.  I'm not saying we couldn't have eaten more, we easily could have, but 3 as a snack really did satisfy my sweet tooth.<br /><br />There was a problem with the packaging on the bag I received - they were nice and easy to open, which I liked.  You just pulled on a plastic strip, and they opened.  I THINK there was supposed to be plastic left to close the bag on, but there wasn't.  Since the inside wasn't enclosed in anything, a closure was badly needed.  This could have been just one bag malfunctioning, but if not, this needs to be worked on.<br /><br />There were plenty of blueberries, and while you couldn't really taste the brown sugar, it was obviously in the mix.  Just a glance at the ingredients, compared to another type of cookies we had showed quite a difference in the amount of some of the ingredients - less of the bad and more of the good.  They're not meant to be a healthy snack, they're still a cookie, but healthier than most of the cookies we buy.  I will DEFINITELY be buying these again!",An Excellent Snack - Packaging Needs Work.

"summarize: Monster Energy gives you the buzz and kick you need to keep you going. I have been drinking these for almost 3 years now and they are great. I ordered my first 24-pack case of these yesterday on Amazon with $3.99 Prime overnight shipping and now they're in my fridge cooled and ready to drink :D<br /><br />Just a word of advice, though. Drink these energy drinks in moderation. Even though the label states to limit 3 cans per day.. just drink 1. Really, you'll feel a lot better drinking one for the day instead of going all out and chugging half the case. There is 80mg of caffeine per serving, 160mg if you drink the entire 16oz can. If you really need two, spread them out hours apart.. one in the morning, and one in the afternoon. The maximum caffeine any person should take in a day is 300mg, but try to keep it at 200mg and lower at most occasions. And if you can, drink one every 2-3 days.. be strong of yourself and avoid the addiction of caffeine this product brings you. This way, you can still enjoy the biggest, baddest energy drink on the planet without risking you with health effects that occur when taken in excess.<br /><br />Don't believe all the hype that energy drinks are truly bad for you. I call any energy drink a ""neutral beverage"", because it's not good for you, but it's also not bad for you.

"summarize: We eat healthy. That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda. By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor.

"summarize: I have always deposited a lot of faith in natural remedies, mainly because they work. A sour orange, boiled which water is drank in the mornings for seven consecutive days... or boldo leaves are my best option. And this brand has great fresh boldo leaves that clean my system in a most natural way. The tea bags are very well presented, they taste like old teas (grandma style) and I recommend this brand for selling what is a great product and even if boldo doesn't taste great, that's how it must be, with its own way to clean bile and a fat liver. I have bought other brands and at times they are almost tasteless. This one is pure and natural. A great remedy through a most healing mother nature. Thanks.",Great natural product to clean the liver
"summarize: I've been trying out a few blended red California wines which I find at a nearby Fresh and Easy Store and a few of them have been exceptional bargains. They're totally unpretentious wines, of course, but some have been exceptionally good values, in my opinion. So, I was back for trying another. There it was up on the top shelf and boldly proclaimed as ""The Big Red Monster,"" California Red Wine 2010. The bottle presented  a lot of hype about how good it tasted and how bold it was, but it didn't show any information about the grape varieties used in the brewing of the wine. Well, I should have known better than to buy. It just doesn't live up to the hype. It's not a bad wine at all. I'd say it compares favorably with many California reds that cost about five to six dollars a bottle. It tastes a little young, and is not really distinct in any way. Other much better reds are available for the same price.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",Indistinct. Not Up To Hype On Label.
"summarize: I've been buying the 20-bag boxes of this tea from the grocery store for several months, long enough to know that I like it, and to make it worth my while buying it in bulk.  Every night I make enough to fill my thermos bottle (a bit more than 4 cups, I believe) in a tea pot using 3 bags.  These bags are a different style than the individually packaged bags, and they come packaged 4 in each envelope, but I can notice no difference in taste or quality from the individually packaged bags that I was buying before, so why not save money while I'm at it?<br /><br />Others have complained about the multi-bag packaging, but since I use 3 bags a day it doesn't bother me at all ... the envelopes are easy to fold over to keep the extra(s) fresh until tomorrow.<br /><br />If I have to complain about something, it would be how the strings are attached to the bags ... I use a pot that has a screen basket in the middle to hold the bags, so I don't want the strings in there as well ... I became accustomed to being able to yank the strings off the bags of the individually packaged bags, but doing the same thing with these bags tears the top of the bag (which isn't an issue for making the tea, just for cleaning the basket afterwards) ... so now I cut the strings off with a scissors ... a trivial thing, but I thought I would pass it along in case anyone cares.<br /><br />So ... if you like Bigelow Earl Grey ... and if you make your tea by the pot, or if you use more than 1 tea bag per day, then this is the way to go!",Same tea ... less money ... what's not to love?
"summarize: I bought this for my sister because she has been wanting to try it for so long so I thought it would be the perfect Christmas present.  She loves it.  Says it tastes just like peanut butter (and that was coming from when she just ate it off a spoon and only mixed with water).  I like it also, but I still think all natural peanut butter tastes better, but this is great for smoothies because the ""peanut butter"" doesn't stick to the blades making a very messy clean up and it gives the perfect amount of peanut taste.  I will definitely repurchase after using it all up.",It's not peanut butter but it's pretty good!
"summarize: I fed my two golden retrievers and cat Wellness products for a long time with good results. I really respect the approach Wellness has tried to take and always thought their ingredients were excellent.  Their ingredient list is outstanding-- human grade meats and veggies/ a holistic health approach.<br /><br />Then we had a strange incident. I opened a new bag and gave it to my dog, and shortly after eating breakfast she became terribly sick for about a week---severe, severe diarrhea. I thought this was a weird coincidence, so I discarded the bag just to be safe, and went through another bag of Wellness with no problems. Then about a month later I again opened a fresh bag and my dog became terribly ill shortly after eating the first bowl-- same symptoms.  (Both bags were not expired.)<br /><br />I can't help suspecting that something about how the ingredients were mixed in those bags made my dog terribly sick. I stopped feeding Wellness to my pets and we have had no further problems over the last 6 months. I should add that my dog had never had any allergy problems of any kind and has always been very healthy. She has never had a bad reaction to any food-- she is a chow-hound and does not have a sensitive system.<br /><br />I reported our experience to the store where I purchased the food and they agreed to notify Wellness. I don't know if the company has looked into this issue or not.<br /><br />If your dog stays healthy on Wellness I would still support it as a good choice given the ingredient list. However, if your dog has symptoms like my dog's symptoms, I'd suggest to you take that seriously and switch foods.","used to love it, but a scary experience for my golden raised questions"
"summarize: I started drinking Crystal Geyser sparkling mineral water, both lime and lemon flavored, about a month ago.  I wanted to get away from diet soft drinks/sodas that I have been drinking most of my life, but still wanted a carbonated beverage.  On the advice of one of my co-workers, I bought some Crystal Geyser brand and have found it to be a viable alternative.  The limon/lime taste is mild, so if you are looking for a strong or predominant lime/lemonade taste, this isn't the drink for you.  I do note for those seeking to avoid artificial sweetners, that none are listed on the packaging of this brand.  Most other flavored waters, either carbonated or non-carbonated, use aspartame or some other artificial sweetner.  Crystal Geyser is the only brand of carbonated water that is available at the grocery stores in my area of Central Texas that does not.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTE1AI"">Crystal Geyser Mineral Water Lime, 42.27-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>",No Artificial Sweetners - Good Soft Drink Alternative
"summarize: I have never tried this brand of food before I ordered this. Nonetheless, I love spicy foods and especially oriental. The directions on the package are easy to follow and the packaging itself is awesome because it includes a fork! Also, there is no way the rice noodles can break unless someone perhaps sat on the packaging. Having tried this just by itself there is NOT a whole lot of flavor going on, spicy flavor especially. There is at most a strong peanut flavor. I squirted a ton of Sriracha Hot Sauce on this and that helped a ton in the flavor department. Next time I'm going to make a stir fry with them which will just add more flavor and fill me up even more! Suprisingly, despite the lacking flavor, this is quite filling given the portion size. I don't know how much they cost in a grocery store because I've never saw them even while I worked in a grocery store for almost three years, but I say its worth it if you want to throw a curve ball in your home meals.",Thai Pavilion Single Serve Spicy Pad Thai
"summarize: I thought I didn't care for decaf espresso since it always had a bitter flavor that ranged from a moderate undertone to an overwhelming bite. I enjoy strong-flavored coffee, but bitter coffee is another story.<br /><br />Well, it turns out that I was just drinking the wrong stuff. Lavazza decaf is absolutely delightful. Strong, full-bodied, but no bitterness. Nice crema, smooth and rich. Really hits the spot!<br /><br />It does, however, have a bit more caffeine than other decafs. Not much, but I can feel it a bit (I'm very sensitive to caffeine - if you're not, you probably won't notice it). Not enough that it causes a problem. But even if it did, I'd probably still drink this - it's that good!<br /><br />Highly recommend.",Turned me into an espresso lover
"summarize: I feed a home prepared diet to my dogs, so treats made in the USA with high quality standards caught my attention. The Bit-O-Luv beef treats are fabulous; in fact my husband thought they were for him when I 1st opened the package. Needless to say, my dogs do luv 'em. I also like that the company supports 2 charities (I checked their web site to find out more).<br /><br />Alas, the down-side is price, price, price. If I did my math right, the cost per pound is nearly $16.00 when ordering the box of six 4 ounce pouches through amazon.com. That's a deal breaker for me for routine use.<br /><br />I did buy them for this year's Christmas gifts for my 4-legged, tail-wagging friends. And I'm sure the company set the most reasonable price they could, so if you can afford them, go for it ... your pups will adore you!","Luv 'Em, but can't Afford 'Em"
"summarize: Okay, to start:  This is acceptable packaged chicken.  It's no better or worse than canned chicken.  It may be a little less salty.  The chunks of this are much smaller than they usually are in canned chicken.  This had that sort of tough texture of old chicken.<br /><br />I bought this mainly because it seemed logical to get a product claiming 7 oz. ""drain-free"", rather than a can with a lot of wasted water and less ounces of actual chicken.<br /><br />So imagine my surprise upon opening the first pouch and finding several tablespoons worth of water inside.  This certainly needs to be drained.  If I had unknowingly just dumped this ""no-drain"" product into a recipe I was preparing, it might have ruined the dish, due to the amount of water it contains.  So:  It does NOT contain 7 ounces of chicken.  It contains probably 4-5 ounces of chicken and a couple of ounces of water.  Since fish packaged this way, such as salmon, doesn't contain excess water, I see no legitimate explanation for this other than fudging on the amount of actual chicken in the package.  When I looked at the ingredients list, it even lists ""water""!  So on the front it claims ""no-drain"" but it lists water as an ingredient....<br /><br />The other thing that really irritated me was the ridiculous ""serving size"" claim.  Federal guidelines for meat like chicken list a serving size as 3 or 4 ounces.  This product claims it offers 3.5 servings.  Even if the package contained a full 7 ounces of chicken, that would still be a false claim; as it is, it's a ridiculous claim.<br /><br />What troubles me about these two issues is:  If the company has this kind of business ethic, how do I know that they bother with things such as, oh, like following sanitation laws?<br /><br />I would NOT purchase products from this company or manufacturer again.  We all have become jaded by the little cheats companies do, such as adding water to cans etc.; but two cheats of this nature, especially when you are featuring those aspects as a main selling point, is really unethical and concerning.<br /><br />Since the product itself isn't in any way superior to other canned chicken products anyway, and since you aren't really getting any more chicken here than you would elsewhere, there is no point even in selecting this over another product.","Okay but irritated by claims of ""no-drain"" and portion size"
"summarize: The only other stevia product I've tried is TruVia.  It wasn't bad, but it was a little on the expensive side.  At least where I purchased it.  Years ago I used Equal, which I had no problem with, then I switched to Splenda, which I've used for years.  However, the ""health"" information keeps changing, so I try to give new products a try.  As stated, TruVia wasn't bad.  This (PureVia) however tastes and smells terrible.  It's definitely sweet, but it has a cardboard type odor to it, and that's the exact aftertaste it leaves in your mouth.  Even using one packet in a cup of coffee makes the entire cup of coffee smell and taste like cardboard.  Coffee is a strong smell to overpower, but this stuff does it.  It really has an unpleasant taste and smell.  Sugar, or sugar substitutes, shouldn't add weird tastes to your food.  They should only add sweetness.  And, while this does add sweetness, the terrible taste is too much to overlook, especially with much better options on the market.",Tastes Like the Wrapper (or the Box)...
"summarize: I have been needing to give up coffee due to the acidity. I have tried several ""low acid"" coffees as well as made my own ""Cold brew"" coffee concentrate. Nothing was quite what I needed where flavor was concerned, and most were still upsetting my stomach. I had already given up the caffeine, so that was not an issue. When I saw the favorible reviews of the Teeccino products, I decided to give them a try. I sampled these ""Tee Bags"" first, as they came in a small box, so I figured if I did not like them, I wasn't out much.<br /><br />I cannot believe how much I LOVED this product! The Tee Bags make it super easy to prepare, and the aroma was great from the moment I tore open the little envelope. The flavor really is wonderful! Very rich and satisfying! I added a little flavored creamer to mine, just as I would with coffee and it was delicious. I am very surprised at just how much this tasted like coffee. It is my new favorite product. I highly recommend it to anyone having to give up coffee. I am looking forward to trying the ""ground, brew your own"" version, as well as the other flavors.","A Very Satisfying Cup of ""coffee""...

"summarize: I LOVE these canned cannellini beans. They are organic, which is important to me, and do not contain any of the harmful chemicals/preservatives that so many canned products have. I also love the fact that there is no salt added, another hard to find quality in canned goods.<br /><br />While I do prefer to make my own beans from scratch, when in a pinch, these serve me well. I have never been disappointed in the quality of the product or experienced the problems that a couple of the other reviewers have had. The beans always come out creamy and delicious...they are good enough to eat on salads (after a rinse of course).<br /><br />The Subscribe & Save option is great for these, too, because it works out to be less than what I would pay in my local grocery store for the same product. Plus, buying products by the case is not only easier, but it leads to a well-stocked pantry. I will always keep these beans on hand.<br /><br />I love Eden Organic products, but this is definitely my favorite!",Great canned product without excessive salt or harmful chemicals/preservatives!
"summarize: I got this product as a gift at my baby shower and I was thrilled.  The first time I used it, it worked pretty well.  The carrots, peas, and green beans didn't puree as fine as I would like and my baby gagged on them, I even doubled the cooking time just to be sure they were soft enough to blend!  The second time I used it, when it came time to blend the food I heard a horribly loud sound and didn't blend at all.  After I got the thing detached and turned it over I realized that there was a crack in the plastic where it attaches to the motor on the base.  The motor was working, but it couldn't grab onto the plastic part because of the crack and it just stripped it.  Until I find out if I can get a new plastic piece I will be using the Baby Brezza as an overpriced steamer and using my Ninja blender to blend the food.  Oh, I also took all the carrots, peas, and green beans out of the freezer and re-blended them with the Ninja drink attachment and all of the chunks were gone and I had smooth creamy baby food.",Worked OK the first time I used it...

"summarize: The GoPicnic salmon and crackers, a reasonably-priced meal, is the perfect choice for those looking to watch their calorie intake while eating healthy as well.  The salmon was a bit salty, but that was likely due to the preservatives.  The dried beans were a little bland as well, but would, by themselves, be a perfect snack.  The fruit and nut trail mix was very tasty and among the best pre-packaged trail mix I've had.  The cocoa bar wasn't my favorite, but I'm not generally a fan of chocolate-type snacks.

"summarize: I bought 2 - 7oz jars in Nov., 2011 for $19 total.  Now it's almost $27 with shipping and only 4 months later?  It is very good coffee and I was ready to buy more until I saw this rapid price inflation.  It was definitely the best instant I had tried--thought I'd found something I could just keep re-ordering and enjoying, but this price increase is unfathomable to me.  Other coffees have not gone up in price so quickly.  I'm afraid this price inflation will continue as Jacobs ""catches on"" more in the US market, so I really don't want to get too attached to it.  Going back to searching for another good instant.<br /><br />I have read some surprisingly positive reviews at Amazon for Nescafe Clasico (of Mexican origin) and they say it's even available at Family Dollar for about $4-5 bucks per 3.5 oz jar.  Sounds too good to be true, but it sure won't cost much to give it a try...  For this review I won't rate Jacobs below 5 stars because my complaint is with the price--not the taste.  It's a nice taste if you don't mind being taken advantage of by the distributor's greediness.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Well, I went to Family Dollar today and bought a jar of Nescafe Clasico and I must say it was really not bad!!  Since I use cream and sugar in my coffee, it doesn't have to be the greatest coffee taste out of the jar, and I think I'll be just as happy with the cheap Nescafe as I was with the expensive JACOBS.  Yeh, I know I'm a bit of a cheapskate, but the taste of the Nescafe was really quite good!",Very good but what's with the price inflation????
"summarize: After reading some of the reviews, I thought this soy milk might not be taste tolerable; however, I got a nice surprise. It tastes just fine. I think that the judgment of taste differs according to whether one is coming to this from cow's milk or from another soy product. I've been drinking soy, and more recently almond milk (unsweetened) for many years. Also, some complained that this is lumpy. There is totally no lumpiness using plain water and shaking (I used a shaker). I thought I was going to need a blender. In addition, this beverage will be a wonderful solution to having a milk drink while traveling. The nutrients are nearly the same as lowfat milk except for far less protein. I did not check for the vitamin D.<br /><br />On the less positive side if you are counting weightwatcher points, this beverage is 2 points; whereas my regular pre-mixed beverage is 1 point. The sugar content is high 5g; (although to my taste it is not overly sweet as some have complained). This beverage seems to have a very slight aftertaste.<br /><br />In summary, I am very pleased with the overall product; especially the cost savings, and the portability. The only reason I won't be using it daily is due to the sugar content.<br /><br />Updated opinion: I have to agree now that this beverage is too sweet, and the aftertaste is bothersome. So, I am only using it now in emergencies. Probably will not purchase more.",Updated - Tasty enough but weightwatchers be mindful

Don't get me wrong, most of what I consume would be considered ""gourmet"", but I was simply disappointed by this product.  I don't get a richness of flavor depth (similar to Hershey), I don't get a natural cocoa flavor...I simply get a raw sweetness from this ""sauce"".<br /><br />To summarize:  it's fine, very drinkable, and does the intended purpose.

"summarize: I normally only drink tea when I'm sick. This tea is the exception! There's nothing like it. I drink it whenever and gladly serve it to guests.<br /><br />Back in the late 70's and 80's I always enjoyed this tea at Good Earth Restaurants in California, which was their signature drink, served hot or iced. The tea is obviously one of the only things that remains from that restaurant.<br /><br />The tea is incredibly sweet, needing no sugar or sweetener and it's strong enough that two bags can easily make a carafe of 4-5 cups. You can find it in supermarkets in California, but not in Florida. I have it delivered to Florida then bring it back with me to Germany.  It's great that I can order it in quantity from Amazon.

I always have to look for volumizing conditioners to eliminate the problem.  This one worked well.  It has a pleasant scent that doesn't seem to linger after you have used it.  I like the creaminess of it, and it seems to coat my hair well.  When rinsing it out of my hair, it washes clean easily, and leaves my hair slick and easy to comb through when wet.  I don't tend to have a dry scalp in the summer, so  I can't speak for the claims of moisturizing my scalp.

The 72% cocoa is nice because it is bittersweet without all the added sugar but not as harsh as the higher cocoa content ones.  The mint taste is light, just a hint of mint. The higher cocoa content like this bar is supposed to be good for you (but does not mean you should eat a whole lot.)  The bar says it has 2 servings, and honestly, half this bar is enough.

They taste different from many of the powdered mixes out there - those usually have funny aftertastes, while the Crystal Light versions have a nice hint of fruit and lack the chemical flavor.<br /><br />My complaint is that these ""convenient"" packets are rather expensive, but some of the flavors are only available in these little guys.  This 6-pack of boxes with 14 packets (each packet makes 16.9 oz, which is 7.4 quarts) costs the same as a 6-pack of those tubes with 5 tubs in them - those tubes make 10 quarts each.

"summarize: Coffee is a very subjective thing.  Some people like coffee that borders on tea, others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous Battlestar Galactica pilot serves.  For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by ""that other chain"" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.  For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.<br /><br />With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn't seem Extra Bold.  Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribu's....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.<br /><br />So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef's Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.  Cream and Sweetener don't correct for this, and thus I'm a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark.<br /><br />I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you.  I like the character of the Colombian Chef's Reserve, but it is not as strong, and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards.

"summarize: Well, perhaps many people won't need to double it, but I really love the super-tangy flavor I get by mixing nearly an entire one of these little packets into a 18 glass loaded with crushed ice. If the price were much better I'd easily give this a 5 for flavor. There is no bitter aftertaste, unlike the Crystal Light Pomegranate Lemonade flavor, and--also unlike the Pomegranate variety--the lemon flavor is remarkably lifelike.<br /><br />Also docking the stars due to the artificial sweetener. I wish they could make something similar using stevia or at least mostly stevia, if the flavor suffers too much. After drinking over a gallon of this stuff a day for months I did beging to get muscle pain and weakness, but I'm not positive that wasn't just a co-incidence rather than the Aspartame. I tend to gain weight easily, so I reluctantly accept artificial sweeteners into my diet, always hoping stevia will continue to become more mainstream and that Crystal Light can give me that strong, tangy lemonade flavor without the Aspartame, sucralose, etc. Then again, who knows, it may be the tasty artificial lemon that proves deadly!",Very Tart and Tasty if You Double the Recipe!
"summarize: I've been eating this cereal for several years now, and really like it.  I previously reviewed it, but Amazon is giving me another chance to review it - presumably because I'm now getting it in the much larger packaging.  So here goes:<br /><br />1.  It beats the price of a good, organic, gluten-free cereal in the local grocery store or health food store hands down, particularly in the large 26-ounce bag (package of three) - price it out on a per-ounce basis and it's far better.  Sometimes this organic, gluten free cereal in this packaging is LESS expensive than typical grocery store shelf offerings.  The fact that a well known national brand crispy rice cereal has recently gone gluten free doesn't matter as far as I'm concerned.  Koala Crisp adds organic to its strong points, and it's STILL less expensive than the new gluten free national brand.<br /><br />2.  I like the taste and texture.  These are NOT 90% air like certain crispy rice cereals made by a big-name national brand.  If you like ""soggy,"" fine - just let it soak a few extra minutes before eating.  It's good either way.<br /><br />3.  In my other review of this product, one person that commented tried to take issue with the nutritional content of the product.  My response to that was to simply compare the nutritional label of this product with the nutritional label of unprocessed whole grain brown rice.  One would have to say that whole grain brown rice was unhealthy in order to objectively say this product is also not healthy.<br /><br />Back to the packaging - presumably the reason Amazon gave me another opportunity to review it.  When Nature's Path (the company making this and other great gluten free cereals) came out with the ""Enviropackz"" for many of their cereals, that dropped the price, and everybody won.  I think the manufacturer is to be commended for doing so.<br /><br />In short, great cereal, not just for kids.  I eat it very frequently and have no plans to stop eating it.  My suggestion: go to a local health food store (or section of a large grocery chain) and try to get just one box to try it out.  If you like it, I highly recommend the ""subscription"" program.  You can save an additional 15% with your very first order, and you choose the quantity and the frequency for delivery.  What's not to like?!?",Previously reviewed in smaller package - this is even better!
"summarize: I love the idea of drink sticks, just pour it in a glass and/or water bottle and shake.  A quick and easy way to give water a kick.  I have used plenty of drink sticks and discovered some are better than others.  This blend is by Lipton and the flavor is a decaf green tea with honey and strawberry acai.  The name of this flavor seems like a pretty robust title to live up to.<br /><br />I must say that the flavor is really good, not too sweet but sweet enough.  None of the flavors are overpowering yet all of them are present.  The beverage is only 5 calories a serving and has no caffeine, which is alright in my book.  My only complaint is that it took me quite a while to mix this powder into the water.  I am not sure why that was the case, but in the large scheme of things this is a minor issue.  For someone who is looking for a good way to spice up their water without too many calories, this drink by Lipton might be a good solution.",A nice blend of flavors and no real after taste
"summarize: I received this as a gift, and did not realize how expensive this little package of caramels was, but they were DELICIOUS! I did not cook with them or bake with them so I cannot say what they would be like in that scenario. I can say they were very delicious just by themselves. In response to the reviews that the caramels were putrid or greasy, I must admit they were greasy and this is probably due to the butter used as a main ingredient. Overall, despite the fact that the grease from the caramels permeated the package, these things are quite tasty. I have not decided if this makes them worth the price, but the caramels are of the highest quality. So you decide! (Four stars for the price!)",a lot of $ for a delicious product!
"summarize: Now I finally have a cure for my terrible sweet tooth!!! I get real bad at night grabbing everything sweet I can.<br />Not after trying the Miracle Berry today. I'll be gorging on strawberries and oranges and raspberries. Oh my goodness, so heavenly!!!<br />I only dissolved a 1/2 a pill slowly on my tongue and it worked just fine. This is just about the most fun thing I get got. I am sure they will help my diet. The lemons were just like lemonade. Very good. Kinda gotta watch it on those as they could be bad for tooth enamel.<br />These aren't going to a party...these are mine, mine, all mine mmmuuuuuaaaaahhhaaahhhaaaaaa!!!",Finally and answer for my sweet tooth!
"summarize: ...so is that good or bad? well, depends.  If you like your ketchup to be the consistency of heinz or hunts, forgeddit.  This ketchup has a consistency that is more like tomato paste from the can....a bit thinner, obviously, but certainly not what the average consumer is used to.  BUT (and yes, that's a big but!), this is probably the most flavorful, tomato-y ketchup I've ever had.  It's not real vinegary (which is what I would prefer), so I only gave it 4 stars, but there is flavor all over the place.  I read a review that said it was closer to either hunts or heinz, but truly, it's not close to either....it tastes the way ketchup was probably meant to taste...like tomatoes!!  I'll be subscribing and saving it from now on, as I'm on a mad rampage to get high fructose corn syrup out of my diet (a direct response to watching the movies King Corn and Food Inc.) and I'm a ketchup fiend.....this product makes me happy.","it you were to make ketchup at home, this woud be it...."
"summarize: My husband and I like using the M&M tubes for storing small items. But the lids do eventually snap off so I wanted to order a few of the tubes. I spent some time pricing out the different M&M tubes because I specifically wanted the 1.94-ounce tube (but not a 12 or 24-pack), not the 1.04-ounce tube. According to the product description, these tubes were supposed to be ""mega sized for sharing"". Well, they're not. You can eat the M&Ms in two bites.<br /><br />If you're looking for the mega sized tubes, these are not it. Go with a seller that specifically lists 1.94-ounce in their description, such as: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Z9804Y"">M&M Mini's, 1.94-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 24)</a>.",NOT Mega-sized as stated in product description
"summarize: Sweet Leaf Stevia Extract is powdered, pure stevia.  There are supposedly 400 servings (1/40th of a teaspoon) in a .4 ounce container, so it works out to be a fairly inexpensive natural, non-sugar sweetener and dietary supplement - less than 2 cents per serving and 1.5 cents per serving with Subscribe and Save - though it will take you a long time to use up one container, let alone four.  This extract has the sweetness of 300 - 360 times that of sugar, is a Kosher product, and it contains no additives.  Also the .4 ounce container is fairly small and has a shaker top, so it is easy to carry with you and use if you are away from home.  You could even attach a very small spoon with a rubber band to the container if you wanted to be even more precise with your serving sizes.  I started out using this in tea and I am now using it in my coffee as well.  It mixes fairly well in hot drinks.  It's easy to get used to the flavor in tea, but may take you some time in coffee. I think that it's worth it to take the time to get used to the taste.  The end result is that for every teaspoon of sugar or serving of artificial sweetener that you ingest in your coffee or tea during the day, you will be substituting a dietary supplement that has been shown to be healthy to your gums and in some studies to lower high blood pressure.  Every teaspoon of white granulated sugar has 4 grams of carbohydrates, 4 grams of sugar and 15 calories.  If you normally have 5 teaspoons of sugar during the day in your hot drinks, you would be saving 75 calories per day - a good portion of the recommended 100 calorie per day reduction to help with long-term weight loss.  The flavor of this pure extract compares very favorably with that of ground stevia leaf (blehhh!) which if you add it to tea will just float on the surface.  Also as compared with Truvia or other stevia plus other sweetener products, it is considerably less expensive and the taste is pure - not multi-layered.  If you want to enhance the flavor and it doesn't conflict with your diet regimen, consider adding a squirt of honey or a dash of table sugar to your beverage.  I am looking forward to perfecting a hot cocoa recipe.  Chocolate and cocoa seem to mask flavors very effectively.  I am not sure how to use stevia for baking.  That will take some experimentation and most likely require combining stevia with other wholesome sweeteners.<br />In all fairness, I have only tried Truvia once in tea, and I found that it had an almost cooling effect on my tongue and considerably less sweetness than stevia.  Many sweeteners come in single serving packets, and as a result they are considerably more expensive per serving. Why not start with a pure product?",Great product - mixes easily and value-priced
"summarize: Yes, I know that ""breakfast is the most important meal of the day"" yada, yada, but I, like many who start the day before the sun is up, don't really feel like eating first thing in the morning. By the time the early domestic tasks have been completed I am usually in the car rushing for work.<br />I have found these biscuits are a great way of starting the day and can be eaten just about anywhere (ok, not while swimming, obviously). There's a lot of calories and oats in there and to me they do seem to be better than a bagel or toast, keeping me going until lunch time.<br />Get them in your local store, as they are unbelievably expensive on line.",Perfect for breakfast on the go
"summarize: I've been eating canned tuna for more than 40 years so that might make me an expert ""consumer"" of canned tuna. But seriously, when it comes to healthy eating, canned tuna has it all; rich in protein, low in fat and calories, and it's an excellent source of essential omega-3 fatty acids which help to lower blood pressure and cholesterol.<br /><br />But most of us only eat it as ""tuna fish salad"", with mayo and maybe some chopped celery, because most of us have been brought up on lower quality tuna that tastes ""fishy"" or simply looks dark and icky (that's a technical term by the way, used by discerning children for decades). I did the same; ate lesser brands of tuna reluctantly as a child, adding everything from cheese to pickles to onions to mask the flavor of the stinky tuna. And the tuna you get in the average deli in my neck of the woods, well it's also cheap and it's usually mixed with sugar to help cut the fishy flavor and bread crumbs to extend the volume.<br /><br />It wasn't until I was in my thirties that I decided to stop buying the less expensive brands and cuts of tuna and try something new, in hopes I would want to eat more tuna, and therefore eat healthier. I tried just about every brand and cut of canned tuna I could find in my local stores (in NY). And what I found was Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore (I prefer it packed in water) is the absolute best tasting tuna I could find. It's so good I can even eat it straight from the can, without doing anything to it!!<br /><br />Although I can eat it straight, I do prefer it with a little mayo as a sandwich. But when I do make ""tuna salad"" with Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore Tuna I don't have to add all sorts of things to mask the flavor of the fish, because there is no ""fishy"" ickiness to it. When I'm in a hurry or just want something easy to make, I simply add a little black pepper and maybe a little lemon juice, and some mayo. It's fantastic, never fails, the quality and taste is always consistent. But, if I'm in the mood for something with a little more kick I add diced fresh veggies and herbs, maybe even some diced cheese like I did when I was a kid. Either way, straight, with mayo, or all dressed up, this tuna is without a doubt the best. I even find it to be better than Bumble Bee's more expensive tuna in the pouch. No need to waste your money on that when this tuna is perfectly fine just as it is.<br /><br />Talking about money, you might notice the change in packages sizes in the last few years, for just about every product sold in the grocery stores these days. Used to be you had the choice of a 7 ounce can of tuna or the smaller single serve portion of about 3 ounces. Now most grocery stores don't offer the 7 ounce cans as the standard size. They offer the 5 ounce in place of it. All tuna's are now sold with 5 ounces being the standard can size, not just Bumble Bee. This is a trend throughout the food manufacturing industry, reducing the package size. But 7 ounce cans of tuna are not gone for good, not yet at least. You can still find them, and I have found, in my travels, the price per ounce for the 7 ounce can of Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore Tuna is often cheaper than the 5 ounce, when you can get it. So, I highly advise you shop around for the best price, and see if you can find the 7 ounce cans on sale. You'll find tips on this and other money saving advice on my blog. See my Amazon profile for details.<br /><br />PS) I've had the privilege to eat wild tuna caught and canned locally on the coast of Washington state, and it is awesome, but I didn't include a comparison to those tunas in this review because they're a local product, not something everyone can get (or can easily get) in a national grocery store or supermarket chains. But if I were to compare Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore Tuna to those fresh caught & canned tuna's, Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore ranks right up there with the ones I've tried.",Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore Tuna is The Best
"summarize: I'd give it three stars for the approximately 50% of puffs that have little or no cheese on them, and five stars for the ones that have a lot (maybe too much?). I have been eating Michael Seasons puffs and curls for at least two years and can't help but notice how their production has shifted from full-flavored to light-flavored (after which I wrote the company) to mixed-flavored. It seems they produce one batch of light and one batch of full flavored and then mix the two. Are they expecting nobody to notice? At least my wife loves to pick out the light flavored puffs leaving me the full flavored creating a kind of bonding experience if you will, but if I were eating this by myself I'd be annoyed. Still, because they contain at least partially organic ingredients, and because they taste so well overall, there's no other brand that beats them so I keep ordering anyway.",Five stars for the cheese flavored puffs
"summarize: I'd been reading about the health benefits of eating pure, unadulterated coconut oil, and found that the little jars in the supermarket were just too expensive. So my search lead me to Amazon for quantity, price and purity. I looked at many options here, and found this one. For me, the taste is a plus, but some might find it a problem. It has a fairly obvious coconut flavor to it, so if you are picky about flavors added to the food you are cooking, this could be a problem for you. I haven't found it to be a problem, myself. My wife won't cook with it because she is generally not looking to add a coconut flavor to most of what she adds oil to. I find that it is even a good flavor if I should occasionally choose to eat a tablespoon of oil directly. At room temperature, (at least during the winter) the oil is solid, and it melts in my mouth. It has a nice smooth texture, with that coconut taste. The color is nice white, like the inside of a coconut. It is supposed to be stable at higher temperatures. I believe it provides a good supply of the Omega-3 fatty acids, which I understand a lot of us may not get enough of. (We tend to get too much of the Omega-6.) I read of a low-carb recipe for chocolate lard, and thought it would work well with this coconut oil instead of lard. (Haven't tried it yet.) I heartily recommend this oil if you are looking for organic, pure, not hydrogenated coconut oil at a good price, (unless you don't want the coconut taste.)",Pure Coconut Oil with nice flavor and good price
"summarize: Goji berries CAN be very tasty and enjoyable, however this is not how I would describe Navitas goji berries.<br /><br />I bought a bag once, from Amazon, and found the berries to be nearly rock hard and absolutely dry.

I hesitated at ordering, as one has to buy a rather large quantity . . . such a foolish hesitation.  Everyone who has it wants to know where they can get it . . . the answer . . . a few boxes from my ""stash"" go home with them.

Their product is crispy initially (I don't eat a bag at a time so they are stored in a zip-lock bag) but looses the crispiness within two days. NOW, the really bad part!! If an apple is not organic, it's been exposed to pesticides and other chemicals right?  The Funky Monkey Apple Crisps are made with the skin of the apple, frequently, with pieces that are skin only.

"summarize: I bought some Good Sense sunflower nuts at Walmart and really liked them. They were 1.68. I was glad to find them on Amazon in a 12 pack for 16.98. Not only was it like getting 2 free when you buy a dozen, free 2 day shipping on Amazon Prime; our ""local"" Walmart store is 40 miles away. If you don't have Prime, it's well worth it for us.<br /><br />The quality of these sunflower kernels is outstanding!

"summarize: Although to me this wasn't bad, I didn't find this sauce to be very spicy or comparable to any other ranchero sauce I have tried in the past.  It was ok on enchiladas and nachos, but not my first choice for either.  I also found it to have an aftertaste that wasn't to my liking when used as a dip with chips or as a dressing on a taco salad.  Tastes are a personal thing, but for my tastes this just didn't appeal to me all that much beyond eventually finishing the bottle.  While I do really like the other Bold and Creamy sauces that Taco bell has out ((<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JRMG98"">Jalapeno Sauce</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JRKEH4"">Chipotle Sauce</a>), I don't think that is one that I am likely to pick up again.","Taco Bell Bold & Creamy, Spicy Ranchero Sauce"
"summarize: I would never have tried this brand through VINE had others not told me it was their new preferred brand of Canned Cappucino and now I see why.  it's 100 Calories and has a nice smooth taste with no bitter, overbrewed or over-roasted flavor you can sometimes get with Chain shop Cappuccinos, Frappuccinos or iced Lattes.  The sugar is a little bit strong at 18 grams for the 8.45 ounce can but overall, that's low in comparison to many competing brands.  It's got a nice strong cofee taste and hint of chocolate which is strong enough to add to some ice and blend if you want to cut your sugar intake and economize by using half a can at a time.<br /><br />Unlike their Canned Espresso, this item does have some thickening agents like Carageenan (a seeweed extract used the way Chia seed glop is used to thicken) and Cellulose Gum which is a plant fiber derived thickening agent.  But most canned Cappuccinos have these and usually higher on the list. It's likely there because they opted for lowfat milk.  The thickeners are liekly to make up for the lack of Milkfat.  Since they're common food addtives and not something I don't ordinarily get in most prepraed foods, I'm not bothered by it.  In fact, itheir ingredient list is quite short compared to some manufacturers' canned of bottled Cappuccino drinks.  At least they don't add oil to it!  As for the Cafeine load - Issimo has 81 Mgs of Caffeine which is still less than 2 Excedrin tablets so that's not a huge amount of caffeine by comparison.<br /><br />I enjoyed this and will likely use it as my new canned Cappucino option.  The price is comperable to my old brand and cheaper than others. As far as the sugar issue goes, I'll likely drink half a can at a time and blend it with ise since that's the way I like my Cappucinos.  I won't be missing the line at Starbucks or all the added calories.  This way, I can choose what I add to my Cappuccino and my waistline!",Smooth 100 Calorie canned Cappuccino!  Nice surprise!

I can really tell that it's all natural, it doesn't give me stomach aches like a lot of other popcorn with junk in it does.<br /><br />I was surprised by the flavor. Usually I'm not a huge fan of rosemary, but this is mixed with the parmesan cheese and the flavors really complement eachother well.

"summarize: My dogs are finicky about what they eat.  Basically, one of my dogs doesn't care for any brand of dog food and only eats it when he's famished.  We've tried the expensive stuff (Eukanuba & Blue) and the cheap stuff (Purina & other brands) and he hates them all equally.<br /><br />The most notable thing about Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food is it's appearance.  It really does look like petrified pieces of beef, and you can see the vegetables in it.  Also, the number one ingredient is beef, which is unusual.  Even the high-end brands mentioned above do not have meat products as their main ingredient, but have corn listed first.<br /><br />Taste test on this product was a success; both my dogs ate it.  And my cat, who only eats meat products, had a few bites too, which is a verification of the meat content, in my opinion.<br /><br />The cost is not prohibitive, especially considering the prime shipping.<br /><br />Will I buy it?

The packaging is slightly different from what is depicted in the main picture of this web page. I have uploaded a couple of pictures of this basket as it was just out of the shipping carton, the way the gift recipient would have seen it. It looks good. The goodies are in nicely printed and well-designed boxes and match exactly what are described on the web page. They are delicious. I like the Partners toasted sesame crackers especially.

I like the Tea & Honey Blackberry Pomegranate flavor much better.<br /><br />In terms of sweetness, though, it is just right.

I like spicy food too, so this seemed like an interesting trial for me, although a bit of a gamble when ordering a whole case. These noodles are fantastic, they have so much more flavor than typical ramen, and in many ways are much better tasting than the typical meals i eat.

It consists of a slightly thickened, tasty, brown sauce containing chopped pickle-like material (about twice the size of pieces in pickle relish but there the resemblance to relish ends.

In fact, if not for my one big complaint, I'd seriously consider getting another AeroGarden, so we could grow a greater variety and have a continuous supply of herbs.<br /><br />However, there's a fundamental design problem with the AeroGarden's pump.  After having the AeroGarden for about a month, the pump became terribly noisy, to the point where it could be heard vibrating in adjacent rooms.  After running through a few steps with customer service, they sent me a new pump.  However, because they've apparently had so many problems with the pumps, they were back-ordered and it took about three or four weeks for the replacement to arrive.  Once I replaced the pump, the AeroGarden was again a welcome cohabitant, virtually silent except for the gentle sound of water trickling through the system.<br /><br />All was fine until I pulled out the last crop of plants and inserted new seed pods and nutrients.  I thoroughly cleaned out the reservoir unit, but within a few days, the pump (a replacement) started getting noisy.  I just called AeroGrow's customer service department and they are shipping another pump.<br /><br />The customer service folks have been very helpful, but they've acknowledged that there's a design problem.  The pumps get noisy because tiny bits of root or nutrients get past the foam filter in the base unit, then get sucked into the pump's impeller.  A small nick in the impeller throws off the balance of the pump and they become increasingly noisy.  The only answer--at this point--is to periodically replace the pump.<br /><br />So, just a little shy of four months into AeroGarden ownership, I will soon be on my third pump.  I'm hopeful that they'll get this figured out at some point.  They're very understanding and helpful in replacing the noisy pumps, but it appears to me that there's a fundamental design problem.  As much as I like the AeroGarden when it's functioning as it's supposed to, I can't in good conscience recommend buying one at this time.  I'd wait until they get this problem sorted out.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />The third pump did the trick.  I haven't had to replace it since.  I'm not changing my rating, however.  Overall, I like the AeroGarden, but their seed pod packages are overpriced and underperform.  The tomato garden was a total bust--lots of leaves, but not a single tomato--and the herb gardens always include one or two plants that die out within a few weeks.  Some herbs consistently do well--basil and parsley come immediately to mind--but others just wither and die (and, yes, I'm very careful about water levels, nutrients, and trimming the herbs appropriately).<br /><br />I think they could do a much better job of selecting quality plants that would actually perform well.  Since this has been a consistent theme with each of the herb packages I've tried, I have to assume that most purchasers will have the same problems.",A Nice Item That Makes a Horrible Racket
"summarize: So far I only opened one can.<br /><br />Let me put it this way: if you didn't know it was a salmon you wouldn't would not identify it as such. It is very similar to canned tuna color-wise (white-ish small chunks) and pretty much tasteless. Not even similar to what I purchased in a ""big box store"" in a larger can (can't  recall the brand but it might have been Bumble Bee too).<br /><br />On the can it says ""Tuna style"" (you can see it on Amazon's picture if you zoom in). Fish origin is unclear except that it says ""Premium Wild"" and ""Product of Thailand"".<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars because I only opened one can. If the second one is the same I will lower the rating to 1 star.<br /><br />UPDATE: second can (and all others after it) is the same. Lowering rating to 1 star.","Doesn't look like a salmon, doesn't taste like salmon either"
"summarize: I didn't really expect this tree to last long.  I gave it to my boyfriend as a gift because he wanted to try his hand at his first bonsai tree.  I figured he'd have it for a little while, have some fun with it, and then it would die.  No big deal since it wasn't very expensive.  Luckily, I've been pleasantly surprised.  He's had the tree for over 3 months now and it's looking great.  He definitely takes care of it (waters it regularly, trims it, and turns it so it gets even sun) but he doesn't put a lot of time into it.  It's very low maintenance and looks great.  I'm thinking about getting one for myself.  It came very well packaged.  The tree had a good shape to it when it arrived and was healthy.  I'd definitely recommend this as a great little starter bonsai (even for people like us who know nothing about plants and bonsai trees).<br /><br />Update: It's been over a year since I got this tree and it's still doing great.  It continues to get new growth and he's been able to train some branches to grow in different directions and change the shape of the tree.  We don't know much about plants but it's been easy to keep this tree alive and enjoy it.",Pleasantly surprised. Still alive and looking great!
"summarize: I discovered these during my last pregnancy. They tamed my nausea so I could eat. They are actually so great that I can read in the car while my husband drives, and I usually get motion sickness just from sitting in the back seat. I'm ordering more for my upcoming trip to help me on the airplane, car trips and boats. I've given these to pregnant friends and they also feel much better. I have also given them to my kids for motion sickness. I just give them half or a third at a time and they suck on them. I don't actually care for the flavor of ginger, but these are fine. I wouldn't choose these as a candy I would eat for enjoyment, but they taste pretty good for medicine (which is what they are to me). Be careful with other brands of ginger candy, some of them don't actually contain any ginger, which won't help.","Perfect for nausea, morning sickness and motion sickness"

True I could find a similar product at close the Amazon price but bulk buying is the best way to save money here.<br /><br />The one concern I have buying in bulk from any source is the experation dates of the product.

"summarize: I was very excited to find a natural beef jerky without any wheat in the ingredient list!  HOWEVER, once we actually got it and read the (very long) ingredient list, we were very disappointed.<br /><br />Here's what the manufacturer listed as ingredients:<br />Ingredients:<br />Beef, Lite Salt (Salt, Potassium Chloride), Chilies, Brown Sugar, Sugar, Black Pepper, Garlic, Citric Acid and Cornstarch.<br /><br />Here's the actual ingredient list from the Hoppin' Hickory flavor:<br />Ingredients:<br />Beef, water, corn syrup, sugar, salt, soy sauce powder (naturally fermented soy beans, wheat, salt, maltodextrin), worcestershire sauce powder, corn syrup solids, salt, caramel color, garlic powder, sugar, spices, soy sauce solids, naturally fermented wheat and soybeans, salt, maltodextrin, caramel color), palm oil, tamarind, natural flavor, citric acid, garlic powder, onion powder, spice.<br /><br />Not the worst ist in the world, but since we have wheat allergies, we can't actually eat the product.  We're also trying to avoid corn syrup.  I realize it takes a while to type out all of the lable ingredient lists, but since these are non-returnable items and will be ingested, it is the manufacurers responisbility to inform customers accurately regarding what is actually in the product.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that a product had sucralose in it...some folks get very sick from these ingredients.  It's my responsibility to read the package and double check prior to actually eating someting (which I did) - but it's disappointing, expensive, and a hassle to get something other than what I've ordered.<br /><br />My appreciation to Amazon for refunding my purchase because of the inaccurate info on the web site.",NOT natural - ingredient list NOT accurate
"summarize: The other day, I put a cup of this coffee to brew and walked out of the room for a minute while it brewed.

This is by far the BEST coffee I've had on Keurig so far!  While it does have Hazelnut flavor, it's not overbearing -- it's a subtle hazelnut flavor.

"summarize: I live in an area in Minnesota where mosquitoes are numerous and extremely bothersome.  Since we have relatively short summers, I look forward to the summer season to enjoy the outdoors, but mosquitoes will literally ruin the summer season if not treated.  In addition, mosquitoes carry West Nile Disease, and a dear friend several houses away contracted this disease while working in his yard.  He was severely ill for months, and was lucky to survive.  To protect my family, I decided to take my yard back from the blood-sucking, disease-carrying demoms.  I first tried one of the mosquitoe magnet devices, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000094YKM"">Mosquito Magnet MM4000 Defender Mosquito Trap</a>,but despite its great hype (and price!), it did not eliminated the biting tormentors.  I then sprayed the yard with an application of Cutter Bug-Free Backyard.  The results were stunning!  For the first time in many summer seasons, the yard was virtually free of mosquitoes. I have been using this product ever since, and am quite satisfied with it.  For me it works better than any other product I've tried.  The best feature of this product is that it both kills and then repells mosquitoes and bugs.  I have found that it lasts about 3 weeks maximum, and that is dependent on the weather.  If it rains hard after applying the repellent, I know I will have to reapply the chemical to the yard.  A light rain does not seem to affect the repellant quality. Although Cutter advertizes an 8-week mosquito-free period, this is entirely inaccurate; the product must be applied every 2-3 weeks for effective mosquito control<br /><br />The active ingredient is Permethrin.  Permethrin is extremely toxic to fish and aquatic life, so if you have a backyard pond, avoid spraying this area.  It is also highly toxic to cats, since they lick their fur and ingest the toxin.  Cutter warns to keep all pets off the lawn until the application is completely dry.  Spray the yard from the outside perimeter in.  You don't want to get the chemical on your feet, as it will cause a tingling sensation (it is a neurotoxin and is classified as a ""likely"" carcinogen.  There is also a link to Parkinson's disease).  Wear heavy shoes or rubber boots when applying.  Cutter instructions say to wet down the yard first, but I usually apply in the early AM when dew is still present. Avoid applying in windy conditions as you don't want this stuff blowing back on you.  Cutter says to not apply more than 14 treatments per year.<br /><br />The product can be applied by simply attaching the nozzle to your hose and spraying.  Spray every single piece of greenery possible, as well as the sides of dwelling, window screens, etc.  The wider the perimeter, the better the control of mosquitoes.<br /><br />While there are risks in using any chemical, I apply the chemical carefully per instructions and avoid getting any on my body. The danger of West Nile Disease is significant in this area, and I'd rather apply Cutter's Bug-Free Backyard than avoid going outside.<br /><br />konedog",The Best Mosquito Killer and Repellant for Your Yard
"summarize: I'm a bit of a purist with both black tea and coffee. I don't add anything to either beverage. I deny the existence of flavored coffee, and once denied the existence of flavored black tea. I'm not one who is swayed easily, but I was basically forced to just try this once. This tea is so good that it became my one exception.<br /><br />The lemon flavor pairs absolutely perfectly with the flavor of strong black tea. The lemon flavor comes on subtly, and ends pleasantly strong. There is no overwhelming sweetness or sourness. If you smell the tea before brewing, you'll probably note that you can barely, if at all, detect the lemon. When you introduce very hot water, the lemon comes alive and puts a nice, subtle, natural, lemon scent in the air.<br /><br />Anyway, I opened up a little after tasting this, and have now also tried Orange Bliss by Twinings. Nothing wrong with it, but I don't think the orange flavor agrees with black tea quite as well. I'll stick to only non-flavored black tea with Lemon Twist as the one exception.<br /><br />I will drink this tea at any time of the day.<br /><br />TL, DR: I used to be a total tea purist. This is my one exception now. Black tea and lemon go together amazingly well.","The only ""flavored"" black tea I drink"
"summarize: I have purchased The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg brand peanuts with several different labels.  They are consistently perfect, with a taste and texture as close as you can get to the old fashioned ""just cooked, hot out of the oil"" peanuts of my youth.<br /><br />This brand is the only one I've found that uses peanut oil rather than the genetically modified cotton seed oil that is used for most other brands.  I think there are a couple other brands ""out there"" that do not use toxic oils, but I'll stick with this one!!!<br /><br />I like things more salty than a lot of people so I usually sprinkle a little extra sea salt on the nuts when eat them but I think they are just right out of the can for most people.<br /><br />If you really want to splurge and have a good food processor -- these nuts make the best peanut butter anywhere!",different labels - same great peanuts
"summarize: I love Zevia.  Can't say anything bad about a soda with no calories, no caffeine, and no aspartame.  My most recent shipment however, was less than satisfactory.  One case had a can that had ruptured, soaking the inside of the box, and the cardboard had begun to mold as a result.  Yuck.  It was not a particularly hot day when it was delivered, between that and the mold I'm sure the can burst long before it arrived at my door.<br /><br />Another case not only had a ruptured can, but was missing one as well!

"summarize: I searched extensively online to find good sources of dragon well (longjing) green tea, and bought this Numi bag as well as more expensive tea from Sevencups, Teaspring, and Amazing Green Tea. This Numi tea was the least expensive of everything I bought. You get 16 OUNCES of this for the same price as 30 GRAMS (!) of Jipin grade from Amazing green tea. That's 15 times as much tea for the same price. I only wish it were as good, but the quality is far inferior. The Jipin from Amazing green tea has far more flavor, sweetness, nuttiness, and complexity. It really is amazing. I don't have a horse in this race (I'm just a green tea lover), but wanted to post my review here in case it saved someone else from buying this when it wasn't what they wanted. If you're looking for value and don't care much about flavor, this is fine. A little burnt and bitter, but drinkable.

Some of the reviewers said the vanilla flavoring was weird or strong, I think it's just right.  I love this tea and everyone that I've served it to has also enjoyed it.  Half of the tea I buy ends up going home with someone else!  It makes a lovely ""chai latte"" or just served as chai.

Given how much mace I use at one time, that's probably a lifetime supply, no matter how often I bake cookies.<br /><br />But it's good stuff - and I solved the 3-jar problem by putting the extra jars in Christmas stockings, my favorite solution for the extra jars of spices and cooking supplies I get from Amazon, since everyone else in the family cooks a lot too.<br /><br />Mace is hard (impossible, actually) to find where I'm living - and so I went looking for it on the internet.

"summarize: The sheet itself came as advertised in regards to the color and overall product.  It cuts easily, and you can draw on it as well if you need to make a pattern to cut out.  I tried to use a cookie cutter on it, but that just left a small indentation on the fondant.  This was no big deal as I just used scissors to cut on the indentations.<br /><br />What I found difficult was removing the plastic backing.  In multiple instances, it fell apart as I tried to remove it from the backing to apply it to the cake.  In the end, because we were not going to be eating that part, I left the plastic backing on, and it looked very nice.<br /><br />Overall, it was nice to use in such a way that you could just cut out any shape you want.  If you don't intend to do anything other than place it as decoration on the cake, I think this is a great, easy product.  My sister used it in that capacity, and her cake came out great.  So in essence, I think it's really what you want to use it for.<br /><br />I have not used a sheet to cover the cake, just for decorations.  For decorations, this is much easier than rolling your own fondant.  Also, I only used part of the sheet, and put the rest in storage as it recommends.  I'll try it again in a few weeks and see if it actually kept and update the review with the results.<br /><br />A tip -<br />If you do any painting on the fondant, make sure you do it after the fondant is on the cake itself, as the liquid from the edible paint makes the fondant disintegrate in a way where it cannot be removed from the backing.","Easy to use, Falls apart easily"
"summarize: I purchased these mushrooms after taking cordyceps for about a year.  Previously, I was supplied by my father who always ordered them online from Mushroom Harvest.  I figured that this price was better so I decided to buy my own.  I should also state that I take them for 2 specific reasons.... 1. They eliminate my allergies and 2.  They significantly  help my endurance.  I gave half of the NEW cordyceps to my father and kept the other half for myself.  At first, I thought that perhaps it was me because I did not feel any effects at all.  I took them exactly as I had in the past for 2 weeks and sadly, my allergies resurfaced which prompted me to be extremely tired.  I had some of my OLD Mushroom Harvest cordycep supply from my dad so I took a teaspoon.  Within that day, my allergies cleared which indirectly effected my energy level.  I was back to running/gym and my regular work routine at my usual pace.  I did not want to believe that these mushrooms were not potent so I would still take the NEW ones periodically for a week at a time.  At one point, I even tried increasing the dosage..... but still rendered the same disappointing results.<br /><br />  Months later, I mentioned the differences in mushrooms to my father.  He said that he noticed the same effects or lack there of but did not tell me to avoid offending me since I bought/gave them to him. :(  He had already ordered himself more cordyceps from Mushroom Harvest.

"summarize: When my son reached the age of having pets, we thought long and hard about what to get him. sure, we had taught him that pets meant cleaning, feeding, looking after...but since his goldfish died 2 weeks after we got it for him, we had to go back to the drawing board. Then I came across the Fresh Whole Rabbit. The fact that it was fresh drew me in. And the WHOLE part, even better! Now we don't have to worry about our son forgetting to feed and clean after his pet! And whats more, when he is finally tired of it, we can have it for dinner. Talk of killing one whole rabbit with one stone!","It's like a real pet, only dead!"
"summarize: When we found out my wife had a gluten intolerance, we thought food as we had known it was gone forever.  WRONG!  We now have superb bread daily from this mix.  I have messed up the recipe a few times (forgot to count on the cups of mix, had too much water, etc) and it always turns out great.  We use a Panasonic bread machine (bought here on Amazon).  I will admit this bread is best right out of the machine and gets dry after a couple days (we store it in the fridge).  We always toast it before making sandwiches and it's good to go.  We now subscribe to this mix every 2 months from Amazon and the price per loaf is awesome.  We started with the single loaf bags and then went to these big boys (save $$$).  One note that we learned from the little bags is to substitute a 1/2 cup of the water with milk.  We like the results.",Awesome bread!  We don't miss the store bought stuff with gluten! ;-)
"summarize: I love sweet iced tea, but don't necessarily like the glycemic load of sugar.  I've tried virtually all artificial and low/no-calorie sweeteners, and they either taste horrible or give me gastric distress.<br /><br />My wife also loves iced tea, but not as sweet as I do, so we came up with a system for sweetening on demand.  As any of you iced tea aficionados out there probably know, normal granulated table sugar will not dissolve in cold tea, and it's easiest to sweeten the tea when it's hot just after brewing, but then the sweetness level is set for that batch.<br /><br />So, what we do is create a simple syrup consisting of 1 part organic evaporated cane juice sugar, 3 parts of this organic raw agave syrup, and 2 parts hot water.  We put those in a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NCDE52"">NALGENE Tritan 1-Quart Narrow Mouth BPA-Free Water Bottle</a>, shake it up for a minute, and voila, a very sweet liquid that we store in the fridge next to the tea.  Then, when we pour a glass of tea we splash some of the syrup in it to taste, and it mixes up nicely even in the cold tea.<br /><br />And the taste of this agave sweetener is excellent.  It is not exactly like table sugar, it has a hint of a molasses or dark brown sugar flavor, but only a hint, and nothing 'artificial' or 'aftertaste'-y.<br /><br />And, yes, I know this is still sugar with empty calories, but I try to use it in moderation and figure that the lower glycemic load of agave is better than full-on refined table sugar, and the fact that both ingredients are organic make me feel better about it as well.","Great stuff, I use it for a simple syrup for sweetening iced tea"
"summarize: I bought this toy in medium for my Cockapoo puppy because he is a big chewer and had been destroying blankets and comforters during the night.  Thanks to this toy I haven't found anything else destroyed.  He gladly chews on it for hours and is challenged enough that he still hasn't been able to get out all of the treats I put inside and it's been several days.  Despite this he persists on and is happy to continually knaw.  I also haven't had any issues with him getting the everlasting treat off.  It is still 100% intact.  This toy does a great job of standing up to his chewing and shaking.  While many other toys (including a stuffed bunny) have been distroyed this one is still intact without the smallest sign of a bite mark.  He doesn't seem to tire of playing with it and is as happy to be left alone chewing on it as he is to playing fetch with it.<br /><br />Overall this is a great toy and easily one of his favorites along with his <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AR0I8"">KONG Classic Kong, Large Red</a>.  He loves both of them equally and they have done a great job distracting him from his distructive behavior.",Entertains my dog and distracts him from chewing on something valuable
"summarize: Although I don't disagree that there is a lot of salt in Fajita seasoning, I feel that this is what it is supposed to be.  We use it on beef, chicken, and other items we are putting into Tex-Mex and similar cooking.  To us it tastes good, is in a convenient package, and is reasonably priced.  We used to buy similar bottles of it from Sam's Club, but they don't seem to carry it anymore.<br /><br />Food products are difficult to review, because people's tastes are so subjective.  All I can say is that this spice is what we expected when we ordered it, and we are happy with it.  I don't doubt that people who make their own, from scratch, are able to suit their own tastes better than this bottle can.","Tastes good, convenient, and fairly priced."
"summarize: I must admit I'm not a fan of the brewed coffee at Starbucks. It has a one-note taste to me, and that taste is: Burnt. I'm not even a fan of most of their beans. There are only two blends they sell that I love: The Christmas Blend (a little different every year, but always good) and this one. It doesn't have that heavy, dark, bitter signature Starbucks taste, so if that's what you're looking for, you'll be disappointed. It's mild and bright, which is just what I want when I go down to my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005IBX9"">Cuisinart Brew Central</a> at 6 AM for a cup. Because of this blend's mildness, I always add an extra tablespoon or two to the pot, to make the flavor a little richer. It's not necessary, but I think it improves the taste.<br /><br />Incidentally, darker roasts do not have more caffeine, even if psychologically they seem to have a bigger ""kick."" This blend may be easy to drink, but it's got plenty of punch in the caffeine department -- my definition of a ""good morning""!","Great blend, even if you don't usually like the ""Starbucks"" style brews"
"summarize: This product is one of those products that just cause you to say Wow and finally.  We have tried very hard to feed our children organic products after a major medical scare doctors traced to hormones found in non-organic milk. Anyone who has ever gone down this route will testify to 1) how difficult it can be and 2) how expensive it can be. This product makes it a little easier.  You also need to be concerned with truth in advertising as the organic market is still self-regulated (an analogy would be the real -estate industry and the classic Realtor symbol, which is largely self-regulated).  Look up Organic Consumer's Association for more information.<br /><br />Before I continue my review, many people will complain about the natural sugar contained in the pear or banana. That is true.  However,as I said before, it is a difficult road to go down and you have to be practical.  It is completely unrealistic to expect to find the perfect organic baby food your child will eat- even if you created it yourself. You have to find the balance you are comfortable with, so don't sweat it as you go down the this road.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051COPH6"">Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1(6 Months+) Juicy Pear and Garden Greens Baby Food, 4.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> is a product that is easily handled and dispensed- thus making it invaluable for traveling.  WARNING-  Keep the cap away from children however.  It could be a choking hazard. If you are on the raod, the contents dispense in a less messy manner than similar products.  Must have something to do with the thickness of the non-recyclable BPA FREE container.  It works out well however, because it produces less mess yet allows a child to still self-dispense the contents.  Each package provides 2 servings so be sure to double the nutritional information if your child eats the entire package.  The product does not require refrigeration, dispenses easily, seals easily, and fits nearly anywhere. The ingredients in this product are all based on real food products and does not ""source"" other products that are based on soy (such as DHA sometimes added to baby food on the pretense that it enhances brain development).  Many will complain about the high carbs and low protein count.  However, the only proven perfect food for babies up to 18 months is human mothers milk with an increasing need for protein as the child develops (my wife elected to breast feed our children for 2 years).  Clearly carbs are a major societal issue but I am out of my realm to realistically suggest a solution. I am just trying to strike a solid balance for my children.  In that regard, and comparatively, this product provides an ample solution when balanced with organic protein sources.<br /><br />Our children both loved the taste of the product as did we.","Finally, an impressive organic baby food product"
"summarize: I already use Splenda as a sweetener, so was thrilled when my wife brought home these Splenda French Vanilla Flavor for Coffee. The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GW68ZI"">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Flavor for Coffee, Mocha, 30-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> is my favorite, followed by <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GW68Z8"">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Flavors for Coffee, Hazelnut, 30-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and then the French Vanilla (but it is still really good!). This is only a sweetener so I still use a splash of ""Half and Half"" along with two of these in my morning cup. These have no calories and less than 1 Net Carb each, so it isn't bad for me to have more than one cup in the morning.<br /><br />Highly recommended!",Great Tasting Coffee Sweetener - Highly Recommended!
"summarize: Like all this food, it doesn't taste like the memory you have of the food in your head. You are looking at this because you want to cut calories. So be ready for food that tastes like the calories are cut.<br /><br />Having said that, if you saute this with some garlic and black pepper, its really good. Tonight I had it with tofu noodles, chicken, broccoli and red pepper. I cooked it with some garlic, an onion and some black pepper. My husband tried it and thought it was great, and he usually doesn't like the this stuff.<br /><br />Use it as an ingredient instead of a stand alone sauce and you will find a ton of uses. But use it as a sauce alone and you will be disappointed. I find that is true with all Walden Food products. But I have been eating this with a low calorie diet and have lost 45 pounds in three months. Give it a try, be willing to experiment. You won't be disappointed.",A few little fixes go a long way
"summarize: I must admit up front that I don't really drink cappuccino. I'm a fan of stronger, black coffees and espressos. I purchased this for other family members and friends who visit. That said, I did taste it and it tastes, well, like cappuccino: ceamy, light, sweet. Almost like hot chocolate if hot chocolate were made of coffee.<br /><br />The price was very good with subscribe and save and still shipped pretty fast, I think it even arrived within 2 days, though as I recall when one uses subscribe and save, in exchange for that extra discount one loses the free 2-day shipping. In any case, it arrived very quickly and the price was 11.xx I think for a 24 pack which is ok for Keurigs on Amazon. I usually expect to pay under 50 cents a cup for my favorite coffees, and this didn't disappoint.<br /><br />There's not much else I can say about this... the cups themselves seemed to require a little bit of a harder push than usual to puncture the bottom in the machine - the first time around it didn't puncture, but closing the top harder the second time worked. I've seen this issue before with a box I got from Sam's Club.",Pretty Good if You Like Cappuccino
"summarize: The heat here is very very mild. I've had habanero sauces and chips that were so hot they made me cry for help. These are not like that. Only occasionally will you get a little kick. It's actually mostly tangy and tomato-y. The dusting of flavoring on the outside of the nuts will coat your fingers in an orange film.<br /><br />Satisfyingly crunchy and tangy, it's really hard to stop eating these. Even though the habanero kick isn't there as promised on the label, it's still really tasty. I highly recommend these. Sodium content is very low at 4% per serving. High in Vitamin E (35%) and magnesium (20%). This 1 pound bag (x3 bags) is a great deal compared to buying the 6 oz tins at the store, however, when my local Walgreens has buy 1 get 1, the price drops to about $0.35/oz.<br /><br />Blue Diamond makes about 8 other flavors that I know of. My favorites are the Soy Wasabi, Honey Roasted, Smokehouse, Dijon Mustard.","Not habanero-y at all, but still insanely addicting"
"summarize: I like spice, so I was eager to try this product.  Generally, I like basic bottled Seven Seas or Kraft Italian dressing, but the name Taco Bell intrigued me.  I tried some on salad.  First of all, the dressing is extremely thick.  I didn't like its texture.  Flavor-wise, I found the dressing far overpowered the salad, made up of iceberg lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers.  The dressing is far too heavy, both in flavor and texture, for folks who enjoy fresh salads.<br /><br />What I tend to do with bottled Italian dressing is add black pepper.  This gives the dressing a nice kick but doesn't smother the gentle flavor of the vegetables.  The dressing might work as a dip for tortilla chips or crackers, but as a topping for salad, it gets a low score.<br /><br />Taco Bell is an immediately recognizable brand name in the fast food world, and the company is evidently using that popularity to have its name appear on items in the supermarket.  As far as Taco Bell's Bold & Creamy, Spicy Ranchero Sauce is concerned, I'd pass.",A bit too strong a flavor for salads
"summarize: Till I tasted this product in the big C warehouse I never thought it would taste as good as it does. I kept it would taste rather unnatural like kool-aid. But one sip and I was hooked.<br /><br />It is a great replacement for all the diet soda I was drinking. This somehow seems much healthier and has less caffeine. One pack is perfect for a bottle of water. I am trying to not buy too many PET bottles nowadays due to recycling issues so I just carry a water bottle and keep adding this pack, it is a good way to drink water.<br /><br />I was noticing that with diet soda I felt dehydrated often and I was getting headaches, recently I also learned that diet cola is particularly bad for the system so it was time to switch. This flavor is particularly nice as it tastes just like fresh lemonade. I also bought raspberry lemonade but did not like that one as much as this flavor.","Great natural tasting flavor, every one loves it - great way to make kids drink more water."
"summarize: Some seasonings are only good for some meats and / or veggies, this one can be used with anything!  It's not a strong flavor, but it adds so much.  It's like a bit of garlic salt and seasoning salt all rolled into one product, but it is unique and tasty.  You can use a little but I use a lot, and it is never overpowering.  It adds a hint of flavor without disguising everything, and yet it is not too salty - it is now my favorite spice and I use it on almost every meat and veggie I cook.  Yes, it has MSG.  But I don't care!  It's delish!",Superb for almost anything you want to season
"summarize: I was eagerly waiting for orgain to put a new flavor out as soon as I heard about it. I've been on orgain for almost 2 years and I couldn't be happier. I switch between the chocolate and vanilla often to mix things up but this iced mocha is a perfect blend. I've long given up coffee for health reasons so this is a close substitute. This doesn't contain any caffeine as mentioned but you can still taste the mocha blend, which is a good thing. I would highly recommend trying this new flavor if you've enjoyed/liked the other variations of orgain!",Great addition to the Orgain flavor family.
"summarize: Beats dunks, starbucks, and even the little no name places I have been to locally.  I usually don't write reviews but HOLY CRAP this coffee is delicious!  Perfect flavor and absolutely intoxicating aroma.  Don't even hesitate buying this!  GET IT NOW!  The sooner you buy it, the sooner it ships, and the sooner you can be sipping the most delicious brew ever created!  If you don't order this coffee your life will never be complete!<br /><br />I gave a cup of this to my girlfriend and it was immediately followed by incredible sex.  I don't know if that will happen for you, but it made my experience even better!",This is hands down the best coffee I have ever had
"summarize: I love Irish Breakfast blend teas. For me, the stronger the better. I don't take my tea with with anything, no sugar or milk for me. Black teas are my coffee, and an Irish Breakfast is my morning cup of Folgers. With that said, this blend is alright. I bought quite a few boxes of it and have been drinking them every day for about a month now. I drink a LOT of tea, probably around 10-14 mugs/glasses a day. This tea I can only take about one glass of before I'm ready for something else. It's just not as good as a few others I have had. My favorite being <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIL602"">Harney & Sons Fine Teas Irish Breakfast</a>. Not too sure what the major difference is in this blend over all the others I've enjoyed, but there definitively is one. Not planning on buying any more of this kind after I've gone through the rest of the boxes.","Nice and strong, but not my favorite blend of Irish Breakfast"
"summarize: These Crown Prince Sardines literally changed my life. You live for a few decades, a good 40 or 50 years, and you think you know some things. You think you know sardines. You think you know tomato sauce. But until the luscious, succulent, inappropriately erotic essence of tomato sardines that defines the Crown Prince line of product grazes your virginal, awaiting lips, you know nothing.<br /><br />When I discovered the Crown Prince Sardines it was a sort of rebirth for me. I had hit a low - my wife had dies three years previously in a freak zoo accident, and I had turned to substance abuse to dull the pain. My reliance on Oxycontin and other narcotics eventually took its toll on my life, both personal and professional. My relationships were a mess, and I had recently been fired from my job. I was sitting in my house, on the stained couch, staring at the eviction notice on my window, when I opened up a can - a little, red, 7.5 ounce can - a can I thought would contain some fish and sauce... But that can contained more. That can contained my salvation.<br /><br />Fast forward a year, and I'm kicking like a celebrity, living on Malibu with the stars. I eat a dozen cans of Crown Prince a day, and it gives me all the energy and positivity I could ever need. I've dropped my drug habits and started to take control of my life. No drug on earth can compare to the creamy, sweet-yet-tart tomato sauce contained in these cans. The sauce, though, is just the start - the sardines! The sardines are the thing! I bid you - if you have ever cared about anything, or anyone, you owe it to yourself and to them to order a 12 pack of these today. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />BUT. But. But. Why, you may ask, did I only rate this product four stars if it so changed my life? There is a catch. There is a trade-off. Nothing this good could be so (nearly) free. And I'm not talking about shipping.<br /><br />Three weeks after I started my Crown Prince consumption habits (which I continue to this day) I started to realize something strange was happening to me. I would wake up early in the morning - full of energy, certainly (thanks to my lovely sardines) but also somehow feeling as if I never slept. I remember one Monday, waking at the crack of dawn. I had a hunger for sardines, but there was something else, too. When I brushed my teeth that morning I coughed. A knucklebone came out of my throw and clattered into the sink. A human knucklebone.<br /><br />I can't say any more. The wrong person might be reading. Just know this: while the power that the Crown Prince Sardines grant is a great power indeed, it is also a heavy weight. It is because of this that I must only give the Crown Prince Sardines in Tomato Sauce a 4 star rating, though they are by far the most blessed and delicious fish to ever grace the sea or my plate.",Crown Prince Sardines are the ambrosia of the gods! But...
"summarize: Oatmeal has been a simple breakfast meal for centuries, but what brand comes to mind when it comes to one brand of cereal?  Quaker Oats, with its simple preparation of either boiling a pot of hot water or placing a bowl with the contents of oatmeal and water into the microwave, instant oatmeal cereal.  Who can ask for anything more in a breakfast cereal?  For the most part, the cereal provides the necessary dietary needs one may be seeking for to start the day.  Quaker Oats has the essential ingredients, low in saturated fat and well for one's heart health and cholesterol, vitamins and minerals, and it taste good.<br /><br />For example, Quaker Oats carries a variety of flavors, but for consumers wanting to try the cereal beyond the basic oatmeal, the maple and brown sugar flavor may be enticing.  It does not taste as sweet as it sounds, and by adding a few fresh fruits to the mix, sliced bananas, apples, or strawberries or any other variety, one has a meal during the morning hours.  After consuming all 10-packets, most likely, one may want to try other flavors.",Oatmeal and all of its varieties

"summarize: I received the shipment very quickly, and started getting down to how much powder per cup to use, and came up with about .5g (a little over half a tablespoon) per 6 fluid oz of water, steeped for ten to fifteen minutes worked out the best for me.  It's a touch on the strong side if you do it that way, so if you like a more delicate flavor, less time is probably the best.<br /><br />Numbed up an aching tooth nicely, and woke me straight up, though no jitters or anxiety.  Overall, I'm quite pleased with it!  The only ""complaint"" I would have is that the packaging is a little, mmm.  Well, clever, but I needed to store it in one of my own storage containers that I had kicking around.  That's it, really.  =)",Lovely tea for very little cash
"summarize: When you do the math, this works out to about $6.65 per gallon.  I use it in coffee and tea and it works great for that but recently I made up a glass for my father-in-law and he didnt care for the taste.  Granted, we didnt measure per the directions because they were given in grams and ml but I would guess that it wouldnt matter anyway.  Also, it wasnt sufficient just to mix with a spoon, we had to put it in a shaker to get it perfectly blended.  Im not sure how it is with cereal but if you're not cooking and you're going to be consuming more than just a bit for coffee and tea, I would suggest just buying milk at the grocery store.  Shelf life turned out to be just 1 yr and 2 months because the cans sent were packaged about 8 months prior to shipping out.","Maybe okay for cooking but its a poor substitute for drinking, and its expensive"
"summarize: First of all - the seaweed salad, following directions, isn't at all bad. However, the serving size is very small. When I made up 2 packs, one for myself and one for my wife, we looked at the quantity of salad in each of our cups, and realized that it was definitely NOT worth $2 for each serving. One suggestion I have is that you add the dressing a little at a time. The first time we made up each cup, we used the entire packet - it was too strong. For our taste, one packet divided between 2 cups was just right. Except for the price, I would have ordered more. When we bought this item, it was $12 for 6 individual servings.",NOT BAD - JUST TOO COSTLY
"summarize: Easily 5 stars if you like vanilla. Its much cheaper than whole beans, and tastes very much like pure vanilla, with none of the bitterness or alcohol taste of extract.<br /><br />It's a bit different in texture than I expected...it is more of a thick syrup, due to the other ingredients (sugar basically).<br /><br />I bought it initially because we make homemade tapioca, but I have been putting a drop in my coffee also!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />I would love to hear a comparison with the other vanilla paste brands on Amazon...as this is the only one I have tried so far.",I use this for everything now...
"summarize: The seller (Arizona Vanilla Company) was amazingly fast and courteous with its delivery.  With standard shipping, it took 2 days.  The shipping was only charged once with the other product (Hawaiian Vanilla) I ordered with it.  For the product itself, it's amazing.  I can smell that teaspoon that I use in baking and I can taste the difference in the cookies.  The only deterrence is the price.  In most cases, I use Kirkland (Costco brand) vanilla for baking, but for Mexican recipes and special occasions, I use this Mexican Vanilla product.  I don't have to worry about running out for Christmas baking (today is December 14).

"summarize: I am not sure how to rate this food. It is definitely better than any of the cheap foods I was feeding my cats before the great pet food recall scare. My cats seem healthy enough (though one of my three cats is trying very hard to be obese... just bought the Aikiou Stimulo cat feeding station to help her loose weight). I have been feeding them Solid Gold for three years now and would have gone on feeding them this forever had I not switched my cat litter from Fresh Step clumping to a non-clumping natural variety and realized my cats have very smelly runny poo. Obviously something in this food is not being digested by my cats. So I took a closer look at the ingredients and began to wonder if the ""grain-free"" idea Solid Gold employs is a great hoax. I mean, how much more nutritious is the potato in Solid Gold as a source of carbs than corn or rice? Also, though the analysis lists this food at 45% protein, the third ingredient that goes into it is potato protein. How much of the 45% protein is from chicken and how much from potato?<br /><br />I have decided I am going to switch my cats to Blue Bufflao when my current bag of Solid Gold is over. Because, though I have taken only one nutrition course, I instinctively know that a bowl of rice is indeed more nutritious than a bowl of potato. Hopefully Blue Buffalo will be easier on their digestive systems too. Apparently Wysong has a ""starch free"" formula but it is way more expensive.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient list. The second and third ingredients are potato.<br /><br />Solid Gold Indigo Moon ingredients: Chicken Meal, potatoes, potato protein, Canola Oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols) , Chicken, Natural Chicken Flavor, Ocean Fish Meal, Salmon Oil (source of DHA), Dried Chicory Root, Choline Chloride, Taurine, Parsley Flakes, Pumpkin Meal, Almond Oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols), Sesame Oil (preserved by mixed tocopherols), Yucca Schidigera Extract, Thyme, Blueberries, Cranberries, Carrots, Broccoli, Zinc Proteinate, Vitamin E Supplement, Niacin, Manganese Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Zinc Sulfate, Manganese Sulfate, Copper Sulfate, Thiamine Mononitrate, Vitamin A Supplement, Biotin, Potassium Iodide, Calcium Panthothenate, Riboflavin, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (vitamin B6), Vitamin B12 Supplement, Manganous Oxide, Sodium Selenite, Vitamin D Supplement, Folic Acid<br /><br />Update 10/29/2011: Just wanted to let everyone know that the Aikiou Stimulo cat feeding station is the best thing ever invented for chubby cats.

They don't seem to be eating as much of it as they used to Solid Gold. To touch it doesn't seem greasy like Solid Gold did. PLUS their poo has solidified! Yay!

"summarize: I like some things about this water...I like that they enhanced it with some decent nutrients. I like that it has no artificial sweeteners, I like the flavor...<br /><br />but come on, all those artificial ingredients mixed in? What good are natural sweeteners if you load me up with chemicals in the end anyway?<br /><br />Here's the deal.

"summarize: First of all, this is really, really good coffee.  Secondly, the cost of these filter packs at Sam's Club is LESS per pot than regular cans of national brand coffee.  Thirdly, the convenience of the pre-measured and self contained coffee grounds is wonderful.  The coffee and consistent strength and flavor every single time.  And, using the packets keeps my coffee maker clean and tidy.  No lose grounds, no nasty filters.  I can literally make coffee in the dark in the morning.<br /><br />These packets are especially nice in an office or church environment where no one is really responsible for cleaning up and so the machine gets nasty.  And where Mr. Neanderthal makes a pot of coffee using 18 spoons of coffee grounds and Willy Nilly uses only two spoons of coffee.  These packets eliminate all that.<br /><br />Would love for Amazon to carry the coffee since I m moved away from Tennessee and cannot buy it in stores.","Love the coffee, love the convenience"
"summarize: Carrington Farms organic milled flax seeds are delicious with a slight nutty flavor kind of like wheat germ. But flax seeds are so much better for you and the texture is great! To get the full benefits of flax seeds, they must be ground or cut in some way or will pass straight through the body with all the nutrients still inside the seeds. They are a pain to grind yourself and measure exact amounts without a scale. These packets are fantastic because they are pre-measured, the flax seeds are already ground, they do not become dangerously rancid, and one a day on cereal or in a bowl of soup is a powerhouse of nutrients and positive health benefits. Centuries ago, Charlemagne made it law that people in his kingdom consume flaxseed because he believed in its health benefits so much! One of these packets has 2 grams of protein, 3 grams of soluble/insoluble fiber, zinc, B vitamins, 90mg of potassium (and only 4.8 mg of sodium!), sulfur, magnesium and on and on and on....<br /><br />The importance of balancing Omega 3 to Omega 6 appears to help so much with almost any type of inflammation from arthritis to intestinal inflammation. The proper balance also can help with depression. As well, some studies have indicated that consuming an adequate amount of milled flax seeds everyday can lower cholesterol as effectively as statin drugs without the side effects. Milled flax seeds seem to help diabetics because of the fiber and micro-nutrients, and also help people with a number of skin conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, and those who just want over-all better skin condition. It may even help those wih dry eye syndrome. It's good for weight loss too with all the micro-nutrients and beneficial oils which help burn fat.<br /><br />I believe Carrington Farms is packaging a little miracle in each packet! Stay with it once you begin with the milled flaxseed. Depending on how out of balance your Omega 3 to Omega 6 may be, balancing may take some time. I noticed almost IMMEDIATE improvement in my well being, arthritis pain, and blood sugar control. Not enough good could ever be written for such a wonderful product! This is a TEN STAR product as FIVE STARS are not enough!",GREAT taste! GREAT convenience! GREAT health benefits!
"summarize: My family has loved this cereal for around 7 years or so before they ruined it. Also, the taste of the new sugar version is very poor. We have tried O's cereals without sugar from our local Whole Foods Market as well as Barbara's, but we don't really like them. For some reason, nothing stands up to the old version of Purely O's. We have now substituted Amaranth Flakes by Arrowhead Mills, which is a superior yet delicious cereal in my opinion (as well as my 2 little girls' and husband's opinions). We have abandoned O's cereals for now, not being able to really like Barbara's or WF's versions, but we will buy them if the original Purely O's cereal ever comes back. Certainly, if Cascadian Farms won't listen to its customers, then some other company should hopefully seize a great opportunity here. Especially since O's are so beloved by and wonderful for (developmentally) toddlers, who may grow to love them young, and keep them as a staple in their diet for years, perhaps for a lifetime. The opportunity for a company here is strengthened further by the huge market of devoted parents of young children who will seek out the healthiest version of O shaped cereal that their children will eat and enjoy... and will even pay a bit more for the higher quality. How we do care what we feed our precious growing tender dependent sweet little bundles of joy!",Cascadian Farms ruined this cereal by adding sugar
"summarize: Interesting to read the other reviews - especially the ones that comment about the bugs.  We've been using Swheat Scoop since we adopted our cat in May of 2010 and haven't had a single problem with it.  There is only one local retailer that carries it and only in box form.  Maybe the bags can be infiltrated more easily by the bugs? Maybe it's the timing of maufacture and the environmental conditions at the factory or warehouse, and maybe its the location of the end-use litterbox and environmental conditions of the space? Or any combination of aforementioned possibilities... or I'm way off. Regarless, observations noted and I will look for problems in future batches - I'll make sure to add bay leaves as noted by another reviewer.<br /><br />I certainly won't plan on changing anytime soon, however, even with the chance of bugs.  This stuff is wonderful.  Grew up with cats and volunteered at a shelter. Will never buy clay again - the dust is awful and the fragrance even worse.  After several years of keeping their cat's box in a storage room, my parents found there was a layer of light, perfumy dust on EVERYTHING when they pulled the boxes and began sorting items for a rummage sale. Just think about that getting circulated around the house! They did try another natural litter after my experience with Swheat Scoop and ended up switching a short time later to this brand and are very glad they did. It only sticks to the bottom when the level starts to get low - so I add more and its fine again.  I try to scoop something every other day - may be a few days in between if life gets busy, but there is still not that much odor. It clumps nicely; however, I try to scoop when I know my cat hasn't used the box in a while just to make sure that the clumps have time to set up. Never had a problem otherwise. Flushing can sometimes be a problem if I get impatient and overload the bowl and then fail to let it soak and soften for a few minutes. But this particular toilet has issues, too.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Love this stuff, so do my parents; we'd recommend to anyone.",Absolutely fantastic - wouldn't use another litter
"summarize: Short and sweet:<br />My girlfriend sent me a bottle for Christmas. She lives in Alabama. I live in Maine. I'm not a 'health nut' and I love good steak sauce. This is not it !  The stuff tastes like Kikoman on steroids. It is so salty that I couldn't deal with it. The bottle says an avg serving has 1200 MG of salt (sodium). That is more than HALF THE DAILY ALLOWANCE for someone with no heart problems, cholesterol, yadda yadda. This stuff is HEART ATTACK IN A BOTTLE !  It also has a bunch of MSG. I am not concerned because I think the MSG scare is a bunch of hoopla from the moonbat lefties crowd. If you're a moonbat type, be advised.  My main complaint was the flavor. As I said it tastes JUST LIKE SOY SAUCE. Not my first choice to flavor a good steak. I would STRONGLY recommend A1 steak sauce or Worcestershire Sauce over this stuff ANY DAY. Also, McCormick has some EXCELLENT marinades that come dry in an envelope. Just add oil.  Sorry to dump on this stuff, but I am being as honest and objective as I can here.",Were these reviews written by Dale's corporate ?
"summarize: At our animal shelter, this toy is a big favorite.  It is shiny, colorful, lightweight and makes a crinkling sound when crushed or batted.  I would give it five stars except for the fact that if the toy gets batted into the water dish, the dye from the toy will leak into the water, discoloring the water, and the cats will not drink the water anymore.  I am not sure if the dye is toxic or not, so I'm glad the cats don't drink it.<br /><br />I would not recommend this toy for cats confined in a small space with an open water dish, but otherwise, this is a great item!","Many cats love this toy, but the dye leaks into their water..."
"summarize: If you are expecting your waffles to taste like a malted milk ball then this is not the mix for you.  I dislike malt but LOVE this mix!<br /><br />It's super easy - container says add water, egg & butter.  I have used milk in place of the water and find the taste better but found that they brown less evenly.  Either way they taste great.<br /><br />All you do is heat the waffle iron. Mix the 4 ingredients and in under 5 minutes you have a super tasty waffle.<br /><br />I have found that the thinner the batter the crispier the 'crust' is and the custardy-ier (wow!) the inside is, while the thicker the batter the more uniform texture. These don't have that cake texture like some mixes do - these are like waffles you get at a hotel or restaraunt.<br /><br />Not overly sweet. I keep intending to try flavoring the waffles (vanilla, some savory, etc) but we always just opt for the plain ones - they're just so GOOD!",Don't let the malt scare you - wonderful mix !!
"summarize: I have a large dog who's normally very soft-mouthed and doesn't destroy his toys -- he has cloth chew ropes and fuzzy animals that are several years old at this point.<br /><br />He went through this dinosaur like an eight-year-old through Christmas morning, though. Chewed it absolutely to bits in just a few weeks, and it came apart into twisted, jagged chewed bits that I feared might present a choking hazard.<br /><br />Might just've been him -- he has strong jaws, he just normally doesn't use them: something about this toy triggered his destructive lust, though. Not sure if that's good or bad from his point of view, but from mine this didn't hold up as well as I was hoping.","Dog loved it, but it wasn't that durable"
"summarize: The Lipton To Go Stix Decaf iced tea mix is a convenient way to get your green tea mix in a hurry, but to be honest, you might want to go another route if you're really looking for green tea. There really wasn't all that much of a green tea flavor, although the strawberry acai is there and quite noticeable (I'm assuming these are artificial flavors). It tastes decent, but to be honest, this strikes me as being something closer to Kool Aid than ""tea."" It just doesn't taste all the natural to me, and if I'm drinking green tea, that's something I expect. It's not awful, and depending on the choices available, I'd probably drink it again.<br /><br />For those complaining about this having artificial, chemical sweeteners and that Lipton is falsely advertising this as being sweetened with honey, use some common sense. Honey has 22 calories per teaspoon and you'd need a whole lot more than one of them to sweeten a 16 ounce beverage. More or less all of the ""Stix"" type drink mixes have to use artificial sweeteners...the packaging is too small for a sugar or honey-sweetened mix.","Ok as a drink mix, but not great as actual green tea..."
"summarize: I have to admit I wouldn't normally throw pepper on my cashews but I liked the combination. There are other flavors as well (a hint of garlic, I think) so the label be slightly misleading. This product is definitely worth trying. My teen loved it too and it disappeared quickly in our house.<br /><br />If you like unique flavor combinations and are willing to kick things up a notch, give this product a try. Odds are, you won't regret it, if the preferences of several teens, 2 adults and one bird (who flew down and ate a couple of dropped pieces - we were outside) gives you something to go on.<br /><br />Some other details that might be of interest: not too salty, large sized cashews, nicely roasted. There. That should do it :) Enjoy!","Although wary, I actually enjoyed these!"
"summarize: I received this as a mistake when I ordered the Zevia Ginger Ale. This is my first taste of a Zevia product and I am sure there i something wrong with this batch. It tastes like a mistake. Someone wrote "". It's just a little bit too much on the sweet side, and a bit flat"" I can't see that this could possibly apply to the product I received. The can of Zeiva I tried isn't sweet at all (maybe 1/4 as sweet as soda) and is overly carbonated (almost like beer). The one can I tried tasted like carbonated water with a hint of citrus and cola flavor, so I think it's just from a bad batch. I""m afraid to try another can because I got a terrible headache after drinking just half of the first (all I could stomach). I still have the headache a day later. I can't blame the product as it could be a coincidence. I just wanted that to be known in case anyone else has the same experience. Also, as a warning to people who haven't already tried this product, apparently Amazon doesn't allow returns on this item. I have Amazon Prime so I'm pretty sure I'll get a refund, but not sure yet how that will work. To be on the safe side, you might want to try this in a store before committing to 24 cans being delivered to your home and having to sit in your living room until Amazon tells you what to do with it.","I got a bad batch, I think"
"summarize: I have used Fancy Feast for years. When I saw the Marinated Morsals come out, I tried them and no I ONLY get the Marinated Morsels, by request of ""Smoky (my black cat).<br /><br />He loves them and more than the other line.<br /><br /> If you cat is like Smoky, where he much prefers cat food with gravy on it, so that he licks through it and gets his meat with it as well. Plus, if you cat likes the smaller morals of food, like my cat does, then your cat should really like the Marinated Morsals.<br /><br />There have been times I have tried to switch to difference brands, but if the pieces of meat or fish are large for him, he will only lap up the gravy. The Marinated Morsals are his favorite.<br /><br />I keep waiting for my Smok to start talking to me, so I can understand his food choices as well as his philosophy on life :-), but until then, Smokey and the others cats that I have had, have seemed to communicate to me pretty darn well as what they want and have all trained me very well.<br /><br />Jon","Since I got the marinated morsals, that is all my cat will eat"
"summarize: If you live at high altitude, be careful when you first open this.  It squirts out on it's own, and the coloring is very intense and not fun to clean up.  It came off pretty easily from the table, but the cloth used to wipe it up had to go through the wash twice to remove the coloring. This is an issue if you are giving this to kids to use.<br />In Europe they make ""koolaid"" with concentrated sugar solutions.  I always thought that was a great idea, as you can control the amount of sweetness.  This is an artificial sweetener version of the same idea. It gives a sweet, light taste to the water.  I liked the taste, my husband found it cloying, my 12 year old daughter loves it and my 15 year old son says it is ""ok"".<br /><br />Uses:<br />Masking iodine taste in water:<br /> I also tried it in iodine sterilized water. It does help mask that nasty aftertaste.  I will get a different flavor for him (peach is not his thing) to bring on camping trips to mask the flavor of iodine.  I will be happy to do that, because he hates the taste of the iodine so much that I worry he will become dehydrated on these trips.  Its small enough to not add too much weight to his backpack.<br /><br />Diabetics (or dieters):<br />This is great for those who need to watch sugar intake and who will not drink plain water.  Plain water would certainly be healthier, but if that is not an option, this will help.<br /><br />Convenience:<br /> I used to bring koolaid one packs (the kind that flavor one bottle of water) into amusement parks etc so that the kids could have something besides water to drink (no soda allowed because of braces).  This adds another option.<br /><br />Consider the ingredients if you are concerned about artificial sweeteners, but this is a nice option to plain water and certainly a better option than soda.","Careful when opening!

"summarize: When I saw this I thought ""Oh boy! ice tea , sweetened with honey sugar and a taste of strawberries"". I should have been thinking ""Oh boy, tastes like raspberry jello and I can DRINK it"". Don't get me wrong, it tastes alright for what it is . Just don't get your mouth all puckered up for tea because there isn't much tea taste to it.  The person who came up with the idea of adding sucralose should be fired. Maybe that was their way of competing with all the no-calorie, low-calorie ""water enhancers"" on the market but I think they will lose more customers with the sucralose than they would with a few more calories. But what do I know?<br /><br />Anyway, a description of the product. The box comes with 10 little packets about the size of a stick of gum. Easy to carry in your pocket or purse. Each packet flavors 16 oz of water.  Each packet has a little slit making it easy to open and an opening just the right size to empty  it into a bottle.  Dissolves quickly. Decaf ,if that's important to you.<br /><br />The ""GO Stix"", in water,  were a little too strong for my taste but I emptied one into a 2 quart pitcher of Lipton iced tea and it gave it a very nice, subtle strawberry taste.

"summarize: I am a label reader - I count fat grams, carbs, proteins and grams of fiber vs. grams of sugar. Most foods that advertise themselves as a ""healthy"" snack are not really all that good for you. Often they are too high in calories or they use products that you just shouldn't eat. This snack food, FoodShouldTasteGood Multigrain chips really is a good tasting, good for you snack.<br /><br />The ingredients are listed on this page and you can see that there are no hydrogenated oils, no high fructose corn syrup and no MSG. They contain grains that are visible in the chip and a one ounce serving gives you 3 grams of fiber. (The packaging doesn't specify if it is soluble or insoluble.)<br /><br />The chips are delicious. They are thicker than what you would expect in a normal corn tortilla chip; more like a cracker in thickness but with the crunch of a chip. The flavor is similar to a popular name brand corn chip (Fritos) only without the added fat. I can see where some people say they have a stale taste - there is a grain that has a mild nutty flavor in the chip that you don't expect to taste in a corn chip. I recommend the multigrain chip if you are hungry for a salty snack that won't blow your diet and that leaves all the unhealthy junk out. I tried the Buffalo flavor and they have a very mild kick; much milder than I expected. I still like them, but not as much as the plain.  I really enjoy eating the Multigrain with a little lowfat queso!",A tasty snack for the health conscious
"summarize: On the plus side, Truvia for me is a very good tasting low-calorie sugar substitute.  Does it taste exactly like sugar? No.  But for me it tastes better than Sweet & Low, Equal, and even Splenda.<br /><br />The problem I have with Truvia -- and hence just the three stars -- is that it is not just a sweetener made with from a stevia extract.  The other major sweetening ingredient contained in Truvia is erythritol, a sugar alcohol.  Unlike stevia that has a history of 30+ years of safe use (with no major bad side effects) in Japan, there's nothing much known about the safety and long-term effects of taking large and repeated doses of erythritol.  Erythritol has simply not been tested a whole lot.<br /><br />So one is rolling the dice with Truvia, hoping that there's no long-term negative consequences of ingesting so much erythritol on a daily basis (if one is using Truvia regularly for their morning coffee or tea).<br /><br />If one is drawn to using a stevia-based low calorie sweetener for the known safety record of stevia (as demonstrated in Japan), then it would be wise to use a stevia sweetener that does NOT contain erythritol.  Unfortunately, Truvia does.<br /><br />On the other hand, if one is only concerned about the taste of the low calorie sweetener, then Truvia is a fine choice in that regard.",A blend of Erythritol and Stevia
"summarize: After trying to find a green tea that I could actually drink and enjoy, I found white tea. It has all the health giving benefits of green tea -- maybe even more -- and it's so very enjoyable! Of all the white teas I have tried, this is my absolute favorite. The white tea is smooth: it has none of the bitterness or sharp taste of green tea, and the addition of raspberry is a brilliant touch. To enhance the raspberry flavor, try adding a little sweetener -- your choice. Drinking a cup of this tea is like giving yourself a present. Thanks Stash, you really do create world-class teas.<br /><br />P.S. Remember NOT to boil the water for this tea: it's far too delicate for boiling water. Instead, use water just under the boiling point and only brew for no more than 4 minutes -- it does make a difference.",Elegant white tea AND raspberry . . . so very good!
"summarize: NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're ""probably"" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a ""tomato"" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like ""Tomato and Basil"" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.","Taste more like ""Tomato and Basil"" than ""Chili and Lime"""
"summarize: This is a decadently tasty snack.  In fact, it's so tasty that I almost wouldn't want it for my snack drawer at work, because I'd eat all the packets right away.  It's good fluffy caramel corn, drizzled with just enough chocolate to give a good balance of caramel and chocolate.  The bulk of the flavor is very sweet, with just a hint of salt from the popcorn coming through underneath.  You get a good amount of product in each packet, though I've become so accustomed to 100-calorie packs that I wouldn't be upset to have a little less product per packet to get them down from 130 to 100 calories (and just put a sixth packet in the box).  The price here is a bit insane, especially with shipping (works out to over $1.50/packet), but I'd definitely buy these in the grocery store for 50 to 75¢/packet.  This would be a great product for bulk packaging for home snacks, too, though I'd personally be tempted to eat way too much at once in that format.",Does what it says on the tin: Chocolate Caramel Corn
"summarize: This is the only cereal my 3 year old son can have who has several food intolerances. It is impossible to find a cereal that is gluten free and SUGAR FREE! There is many choices with one or the other, but we need both. I have looked and looked everywhere, and this is the ONLY option that he can have. The great thing is that he loves it! He is 3 years old, and he begs for cereal and milk (rice milk). I add a little bit of honey to it to sweeten it up a little for him. I love that I know exactly what he is getting with this cereal. With only two ingredients, it isn't hard to know what's in it! I am wondering if maybe the people who don't like the taste are used to the junk food cereal that we see in the cereal aisle at the grocery store. Have you ever read what is in a box of cornflakes from the cereal aisle? This cereal is perfect for anyone who is getting back to basics, or trying to watch what their kids are eating. I wish a lot of other companies would take a cue from Erewhon and give us some cereal that is pure without a lot of unnecessary garbage in it! The best part is he loves this cereal, and Amazon runs out of it so often I have a hard time keeping it in the house! Great cereal to try if you are tired of filling your body with garbage, or have special dietary needs. But be aware that when you are going to organic and gluten free, it may take a little while for your tastebuds to adjust to eating real food again.

Super high protein and they are very light. I found them cheaper at a local store ($6 for 6), but they sell out quickly so I've had to order from amazon. The other Oskri bars are tasty, but low in protein, so we only get the ones labelled protein bars.

"summarize: Okay, the doctor said, after the second heart attack that some changes could help. Caffeine was one area. But I did not want to give up my coffee, and it was always Starbucks (home brew), no store in our small town. I've been hooked on the strength and goodness of Sumatra for years. No restaurant in our area makes coffee as good as my wife makes my home brew Sumatra. So I give Decaf Sumatra from Starbucks a try.<br /><br />HONEST, NO LIE, I COULD NOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE. I even tried mixing half regular with half decaf. It always comes out tasting great and tasting like Starbucks Sumatra.

"summarize: I've been using this cup/filter combo everyday for 2 months or so.  The cup is nicely constructed and I have no problems with it.<br /><br />However, the filter does not perform very well if you use tea leaves that are very small.  I drink PG Tips loose leaf everyday, 3 times a day.  The leaves are fine and the holes at the bottom of the filter allow the tiniest tea particles to fall through.  If this doesn't bother you, the system works.  If you don't like tea particles at the bottom of your clear cup, it will begin to annoy you.  I bought this system thinking that the few flakes at the bottom of the cup would not bother me but i have resorted to using the filter in another cup and pouring the leaf-free liquid into my drinking cup because there are many unfiltered leaves at the bottom of the cup.  Imagine the entire bottom of the cup covered in the tiniest leaf particles...<br /><br />Also, the filter stains easily.  After two months, there is a hint of yellow orange stain on the side filters.<br /><br />Therefore, if you use larger tea leaves, this system may work decently for you.  If you drink tea like the loose leaf PG Tips that have fine leaves, I would look for an alternative.

"summarize: The Caribou Blend k cups have fulfilled our household's need for a plain old cup of coffee in the morning that isn't anything fancy, but still gets the job done.

"summarize: It tastes better (coffee, tea, cereal, baking, et al.) than processed cane sugar (and ANY artificial sweetener).  Although I am not quite as sensitive to the details of my body's interest in or acceptance of various sweeteners as other reviewers, the stuff seems just fine.  Have used all the various artificial products, and they taste...well, artificial - esp. Truvia which has a vile aftertaste.  Organic, fair trade, and tasty - seems OK to me.  And since I am not a food scientist and lack access to a full-on laboratory (More agave, Igor), I can't comment on web-based assertions of dubious provenance.  As I wrote, tastes good and seems like a sensible alternative to the rest of the crowd.","Tasty stuff and apparently, small amounts fuel rampant paranoia"
"summarize: This product really sounds like a healthy alternative to a dinner side dish. I was very excited to try it. But the instructions are very poor. As this is a new item for me, I tried my best to prepare the vermicelli per the package directions, and added some parsley, hot pepper, garlic and shrimp to jazz it up a bit. It came out very dry and tasteless.<br /><br />For those thinking of trying this, I hope you are very creative. Don't do what I did.

"summarize: To get the most benefits out of your extremely shelf-unstable flax seeds, you really should buy them whole and grind them yourself (I have a coffee mill for only this purpose). However, that is not always convenient, so buying already milled seeds is an option. For milled seeds, this isn't the tastiest or the freshest I've had--Bob's Red Mill pre-milled flax seeds taste much fresher, and the seeds aren't milled to a near powder. You can still see some texture and shape. These seeds are okay, but don't really add any flavor or depth. Go with Bob's or mill your own.",You really should buy it whole and grind it yourself.
"summarize: I've bought cases of Seedlander flatbreads which I love, but they make a mess when I break them apart into cracker size pieces. Since I have a gluten intolerant family member, I don't like spreading cracker dust around the kitchen counters.<br /><br />4 instead of 5 stars because I don't think they taste exactly the same as Seedlander flatbreads. Maybe it's my imagination? Maybe it's this production batch?<br /><br />Cost: When I compared per ounce (these have less weight per box than flatbreads) their price seemed favorable.<br /><br />I do appreciate the convenience of being cracker sized. Overall, I'm glad I purchased them.",don't seem to match the flatbreads
"summarize: My dog is 12, and has had constantly firm stool his whole life.  After a dental surgery, I used these, and assume the medicine was giving him diarrhea.  After he was better, and no more pills... I was still using these leftover pockets to smear into an old hollow bone (they are very pliable and many are cracked and smoooooshed, already, prior to opening the package), and he continued to have diarrhea.  I was just worried something happened due to the mediciation, but finally put two and two together.  Googling these pill pockets, diarrhea is a side effect.  So be aware.  These work well for the pill part, but the drawbacks are there too.<br /><br />Also, I haven't talked about diarrhea this much in my whole life.  I have heard the only time it's good to have diarrhea is in scrabble, because it's worth a crapload of points. I saw someone on Twitter ask Greenies if Diarrhea was a side effect.. the question is hilarious: [...]<br /><br />Anyhoo... we love our dogs.  We hate messy poop.  There may be better ways.  Making the poopy that loose makes me think it can't be too healthy?","This *may* give your dog diarrhea, but they do their job."
"summarize: PB2 is a staple in my kitchen. I also keep a container at work to make quick and easy snacks. It's a powdered peanut butter - peanuts with most of the fat removed, plus small amounts of sugar and salt for flavor. The amount of sugar per 2 tablespoon serving is only 1 gram (equivalent to 1/4 of a teaspoon). I'm a dietitian and recommend this to my patients who need to follow low fat diets but don't want to give up peanut butter. My favorite way to eat this is with apple slices, although I've had patients tell me they like to dip their fresh fruit directly into the powder. Amazon seems to have the best prices for this item.",Great tasting low fat peanut butter
"summarize: I wasn't too fond of this cereal in any way. Out of the box, it has a strange, artificial butterscotch color. If it only tasted like butterscotch, I could forgive this unusual shade. But Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut & Honey is far from Kellogs' best effort! The cereal was rather bland, and the promised crunch reminded me only of the familiar ""Captain"" cereal of the same name. I just did not get the nut and honey experience that is available in other brands. As a new cereal on the market, this cereal won't last long, I predict. It isn't anything different than those that have been around awhile, those that present this variety much, much better. Also . . . Vine clearly stated ""10.8 oz. pack of four"" and I just received one box. Not that I miss it, but I at least could have given the promised remaining three to my sons who are in college. (There was no disclaimer that Vine reviewers would receive only one box.)",Humdrum cereal for an everyday breakfast
"summarize: I eat about 3 tablespoons of VCO per day.<br /><br />I have used Garden of Life and Spectrum Brands, both of which were the UNREFINED versions.<br />Those brands were delicious and Bronners Fresh Pressed Virgin Whole Kernel is no exception.<br /><br />I prefer unrefined, flavorful coconut oil and this is exactly what I got.  I eat it straight from the bottle and it does not make me gag at all.  I love it!<br /><br />Not only is it delicious with a taste of toasted coconut, it really smoothes the skin out.<br /><br />I think that I will start cleansing my face with this rather than soap, I have read that people do this.  I will try that and write an update.<br /><br />BTW, Bronners sells two version of their VCO, this Whole Kernel Unrefined and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052AIF00"">Dr Bronner's Fresh-pressed Virgin Coconut Oil White Kernel Unrefined 14 Fl Oz</a>.<br /><br />According to Bruce Fife, an expert on Coconut and Coconut oil,<br /><br />The difference between the ""white kernel"" and ""Whole kernel"" is that the whole kernel includes the brown membrane that separates the kernel from the shell. According to Fife, this membrane has a higher content of unsaturated fatty acids.<br /><br />According to the manufacturer's website, ""Whole kernel oil, which is made from the kernel with its ""parings"" is more nutritious and has a slightly nuttier flavor whereas white kernel oil offers a choice to consumers who are familiar with this grade. Both grades are versatile and healthy along with being organic and fair trade.""<br /><br />UPDATE:  I missed this the first time.  Bronners' VCO is made from dried coconut as is Spectrum. Whereas Garden of Life VCO is is made from freshly picked coconuts that are used within 24-48 hrs, the coconut meat shredded (not dried) & cold-pressed using the water from inside the coconut, then fermented to extract the oil.<br /><br />I just received some Tropical Traditions coconut oil and will review and compare shortly.","Delicious to eat, great for skin!"

It kills me when I buy these and see all the packaging used for 4 measley appplesauces. This company really has a good product, but the pricing and packaging are way too high. I was hoping by buying them in bulk that they would come separately without the cardboard box. Still not great, but would be better. Not so!

summarize: Natural Balance Limited Ingredient Dogs Foods are working for my allergy prone cockapoo.  After many years of buying expensive hypoallergenic vet food that still caused gastrointestional problems for my dog...I was wondering if I would ever find a food that he could eat.  I was feeding him boiled chicken and rice when I ran across this product line.  It has been over a month now and he is doing very well.  He is not vomiting and eating grass or having severe gas and bowel problems.  His itching has dminished by at least 70% and he has a twinkle in his eyes again and I'm not pulling my hair out trying to find a solution!  Now we will see how he does on this long term.  Thank goodness there are some products designed for dogs with allergies that do work.,Natural Balance Dog Food - Answer to Prayer
"summarize: We have a tiny little 8 lb maltese, and we got him the mini size bag of these.  Each time we give it to him, he seems to love it, but he had HORRIBLE diarrhea that led to multiple vet visits (it was awful, pretty much the worse diarrhea he's ever had at age 3).  I noticed about 8 hours after he ate the nutrident, the diarrhea started and it had turned blackish green.  Fast forward 2 months, and our dog was nursed back to health and happy...I didn't think that the nutrident was the cause of the diarrhea earlier, I thought it just made it worse so I gave him another one.  Wrong.  About 6-8 hours after, I noticed his normally firm stools were extremely soft and once again, they were blackish green.  I promptly threw the entire bag in the trash.  Terrible product and I will never be buying these again.  As a side note, my little guy tolerates and loves Greenies just fine.  I'll pay the extra few bucks for the Greenies to make sure he isn't food poisoned by these ever again.",Gave my dog horrible diarrhea twice...
"summarize: I was just starting to think about healthy foods, granola, etc, and this came up as a good deal.  If you are thinking about adding or switching to granola, this has a great taste!  Who doesn't like sugary maple?!?!?  This was great!  I was eating granola, it didn't taste like cardboard, I can eat healthy has it's not so bad!  Well, I have one of those Weight Watcher cards from a few years back *ahem* and I calculated that 3/4 cup of this is 4 points.  3/4 cup isn't so much, but it's fine since this is granola, for me, it took a lot longer to chew so I was satisfied.  The 2 other reviews says it's healthy...yes, probably healthier than Frosted Flakes or Froot Loops, I suppose.  The box doesn't even claim ""healthy"", just ""organic"".  So be careful if you are looking for ""healthy"" too.<br /><br />A week later, I bought Fiber One Caramel Delight and for 1 cup, it was only 2 points and the flavor was GOOD!  So, if you are looking for good flavored granola only, I'd recommend this.  If you are looking to eat more healthy, try the Fiber One Caramel Delight first, I'm going to review that for 5 stars.<br /><br />FYI - I paid $12.20 (with subscribe and save) for a pack of 5.

Though I hesitate to pick a favorite, I have to say that I love green apple, a rare flavor in drugstore jelly beans.  Each flavor tastes like the fruit it is modeled after, not like the tart candy version of that fruit.  I even love the cherry flavor, and I hate cherry flavored candy.  I don't find them similar to Starburst candy, so don't let that put you off if you're not a fan.

"summarize: My mate & I consume more fresh ground coffee by Starbucks, than I ever thought possible. We recently (last year) decided to expand our taste buds, and try some other flavors, other than our usual favorite Breakfast Blend. Everything turned into our newest favorite. We were ridiculous with our 5 different bags of Starbucks Beans Coffee in our freezer. We tried the Cinnamon........ It looked as though our coffee pot was bombed. None of the other coffees do this. Even the competition coffee doesn't do it. After several tries, we decided to discontinue using the Cinnamon. I want to stress, that the flavor wasn't the issue. However the flavor may have something to do with it as well. We noticed that all the other flavors had the same consistency and weight. For some reason the Cinnamon seemed lighter, fluffier. It's as if it was ground differently than the others, making it a different texture, thus allowing it to splatter and float, getting into the carafe, and inevitably into our mouths.......so, maybe Starbucks can remedy, and if they do, we will eagerly retry and enjoy! Thanks- GrayBeard<br /><br />PS- We have tried Starbucks other delicious ""Natural"" flavors,(i.e.Vanilla, and Caramel) and have NOT experienced the same tragedy. ONLY the Cinnamon has this issue.....interesting, huh?","Starbucks rules, but their Cinnamon Coffee floats"
"summarize: I usually buy wheat berries in bulk but had no other choices yesterday and bought the only brand (Nature's Earthly Choice, packaged) carried in my local market. Not only is Nature's Earthly Choice about FIVE times as expensive as buying in bulk (even from the high-end national chain store), but Nature's Earthly Choice is also more expensive than virtually all other brands. And after cooking, Nature's Earthly Choice Wheat Berries looked awful - as if they'd been totally overcooked and every kernal had exploded. (Perhaps that's because they've been turned into a ""cooks in 15 minutes"" processed grain.) Cooking instructions on the package are almost non-existant -- no mention of medium or low flame, covered or uncovered, whether all the water was all supposed to be absorbed or what. The salad recipe on the package made it sound like there should've been no excess water, so after 20 minutes on an uncovered simmer I figured I was supposed to drain the berries. I know I'll end up feeling like I should apologize to fans (of my usual apple salad with wheat berries) about how it looks.  Very disappointing and a ripoff.",why so expensive -- and what's with the texture?

"summarize: We bought this chocolate last year when they had the big sale on it here on Amazon. It was just great. Scharffenberger milk chocolate has a deep rich flavor with a great snap and the texture is very smooth.<br /><br />This latest batch of ""Scharffenberger Milk Chocolate"" is obviously Hersheys attempt to make it more profitable by removing any value from it. It is lighter in color with a slightly chalky and waxy texture, it is barely creamy and the texture and flavor are not remotely as good as the actual Scharffenberger used to be.<br /><br />It is much more a third rate Swiss style chocolate and completely lacks the straight forward high quality chocolate flavor that real Scharffenberger had. And if you want Swiss style chocolate you are much better off buying Lindt or Tobler than this over priced and very poor imitation.<br /><br />This is not nearly as good as the original bar. It seemed obvious that Hershey's would eventually abandon Scharffenbergers high standards, quality beans and traditional methods and simply try to maximize profits. This ""chocolate"" proves that beyond any doubt.<br /><br />In the end, it seems they probably only bought the company to eliminate it from being competition.<br /><br />They are certainly destroying any remaining brand loyalty now.",A very pale shadow of its former self!
"summarize: This is an add-on to my recent review...<br />I do like these bars, but in the news recently there has been a lot of talk about high levels of arsenic in rice, particularly rice syrup. Unfortunately, the first ingredient in these bars is just that. I emailed Oskri, and while they were extremely quick in replying to my first email to them asking about their sugar ingredient as indicated in my post below, they have never replied to my inquery about the rice syrup and what, if any, testing had been done. So, until they do that, I will stop purchasing (and eating) this product.<br /><br />I have tried almost every type of protein bar there is. Normally, they have a ton of added sugar. (I am a label reader...) I bought my first Oskri bar in a local Health Food store -- a fiber bar. I was surprised that the ingredients didn't say ""sugar,"" yet it had a sugar content. So, I was curious and checked with the company to see what exactly was holding it together and what the sugar was -- chickory root. Someone actually figured out how to make a completely natural product?? I then had to find what other flavors they had. The almond and cranberries are my favorite. Nothing else can compete! I am buying them by the box now (thank you, Amazon!).<br /><br />I also bought the fig bars. I made the mistake of not checking the ingredients first, though. But, was pleasantly surprised to find that the bars were 100% fig. That is unheard of! How more natural can you get?? If you like Fig Newtons, you will love the figs.-- They just don't have the dough wrapper! And, they come in a mini size, which are perfect and hit the spot.

"summarize: I make a latte with this every morning. I use two tablespoons of this or the regular Nido and a bit of stevia liquid (Kal brand is the best) and use two short pours (about 3.5 oz. total) of hot water from my Nespresso and then froth with my Black & Decker frother. Both sold here. Tilt the glass and keep the frother near the top after initial mixing. Makes delicious, thick froth as good as Nespresso's. I then add a 4 oz. pour of espresso. I use the Ristretto. Mix for a second with the frother so there's still milk froth on top and add a dash of cinnamon. Delicious and only 80 calories.

This Clear shampoo is slightly creamy in texture, rinses out easily and leaves both my hair and scalp feeling very good. It has a slight soapy/floral scent (reminds me of those little hotel soaps) but it's not overwhelming like Pantene, and only a very slight fragrance is left on my hair. The slim bottle and one-fingered dispenser cap are also very easy to use in a shower. I think I'll take this to the gym!",Leaves hair soft and not overly fragrant
"summarize: Edit:  Added a second part.<br />===============================================<br />Original Post<br />I use this with the whirleypop, which I'm expecting to break any minute, but that aside, this makes near perfect popcorn.  The coconut taste is a little bit stronger than what you'd find in movie theatres but overall a bit bland (which is not a bad thing).  I frankly prefer that than trading the health benefits for overly processed oil.  That and while I love coconut trading the near tasteless flavor of the oil for a strong coconut flavor would reduce it's versatility in cooking.<br /><br />So when you salt this lightly with popcorn it stands on its own.  But I season mine with kernel's seasons, splenda, sugar, some salty butter flavoring along with melted Nutiva, mixed then drizzled on top.  In short, it's one step short of heaven and the switch from Canola is immediate and amazing.  I honestly can't stop eating it and it is rather healthy in comparison to movie theatre popcorn as I use far less and still has a very similar oil fragrance and taste.  Yes I still treat it like an oil and use about 2.5 to 3 tablespoons for a 1/3 cup of unpopped corn.<br /><br />On that note, while I applaud the brave reviewers out there who put this on their hair, and eat it religiously daily this is still an oil.  Perhaps a high quality one and one I may put on my split ends one day, but to me this is a yummy cooking oil you use in moderation.<br /><br />It also is a tad expensive (hence subbing a star) and again I do find it too bland to use alone on toasted bread (perhaps it has to be toasted together in the toaster oven) but the quality and convenience is really good.<br /><br />So if you happen to use it in other ways, good on you but I am happy with using it sparingly, and simply for popcorn.  It seems much more useful to me than using it as the latest and greatest in health fads today.  Especially because oil, even when healthy, contributes a hefty amount of calories and fat to your diet.<br /><br />==========================================================<br />Note about the Coconut Oil Hype<br /><br />Seems like a few people are very into the hype, so much so that if you do not write an overly glorifying review of coconut oil something is wrong with you.  I'm not a believer in ONLY scientific studies and if that were the case I would not care for reviews by buyers from amazon.  And frankly I love you reviwers as you save me time and money.  However I do have a limit on what I hear from the internet.  And whenever there is the word ""miracle"" attached to something in the title I use a heavy amount of skepticism.  And MANY people believe coconut and coconut oil is a ""miracle"".<br /><br />Sorry folks it isn't.  I do realize all the benefits of coconut water by the way. Coconut water is extremely healthy and even used as in emergencies to substitute for human blood, but even so I would hesitate to call coconut water a ""miracle"" as drinking it alone is not a cure for aids, cancer, etc. as suggested by some. That, to me would constitute a true miracle. And if it were true, coconuts would have been discovered a long time ago as a cure for aids/cancer, etc.<br /><br />Coconut water is undoubtedly good FOR you and I love coconuts as a whole but do use some discretion when eating OIL.<br /><br />To me, if you're thin, eating fat is not so much an issue when the fat is healthier and you probably need some caloric substance. Extra virgin coconut oil, while still being researched, comes from a coconut and thusly is inherently healthy to some degree. However, if you're already overweight, then eating 3 tablespoons of oil, ANY oil, on TOP of what you eat amounts to 390+ calories extra which means you gain a pound in only 10 days.  It is VERY easy to overeat oil and that said I would really hesitate to overuse coconut oil or any oil without extensive studies.<br /><br />So those reading what I wrote, as of March 3rd, 2011 coconut oil is still being heavily studied.  Just google it if the following links do not show.<br />[...]If you're on the fence, don't consider it (or anything for that matter) a miracle until long term studies ARE done.  If it's oil, keep in mind moderation is always the key.  Don't buy the hype to eat 3 tablespoons a day if you're already overweight.","Near Perfect for popcorn, experimental for other things"
"summarize: Since it's summer and extremely hot outside, I expected these cookies to be very nearly melted when I opened the package.  But they were still perfectly intact.  And were not actually gooey at all.  The chocolate filling in them is soft and a little grainy as cooked chocolate tends to be.<br /><br />What I do love about these cookies is that the chocolate inside is dark chocolate.  In my experience, chocolate chip cookie fans like milk chocolate in their cookies.  I tend to prefer oatmeal and dark chocolate in my cookies--trick myself into feeling like it's a healthy cookie--but in most cookie crowds, my preference seems to be in the minority.  I am so glad the good people at Chips Ahoy see things the way I do.  Well, no oatmeal in there, but it is dark chocolate.<br /><br />They don't taste like fresh-baked cookies.  They are soft and moist, which is good, but they do taste packaged and preserved.  I guess that's not so shocking considering that they are actually packaged and preserved.  The cookies are small... I don't see a problem with that... as they are soft cookies; their size keeps them from crumbling under their own weight.<br /><br />I asked my 8-yr-old daughter to ""review"" these cookies.  I did use the word ""review.""  She said, ""They taste like cookies.  With extra chocolate.""  Then, feeling that a review should probably be more creative, she announced, ""It's like there are stars bursting in my mouth!!""  Yes, creative, but I have no idea what that is really supposed to mean.  Means she likes them I guess.","Mine were not gooey, but they were good."
"summarize: I should start by saying I only give my baby 4-8 oz of formula a day, otherwise she's breastfed, so the issues I have with this product minimally effect us.<br /><br />It is important to me to give my baby organic food whenever possible, so that is the main reason I picked this product to begin with, also when I purchased the price was better than other organic formulas and it doesn't have corn syrup in it.<br /><br />The downsides:<br /><br />It is difficult to mix, you must use warm/hot water in order to get the lumps out.  And it gets ridiculously frothy when shaken up, like the entire bottle is foam.  What I do now is make a bottle at least a few hours ahead of time and stick it in the fridge, by the time I need to use it, the air bubbles are gone.<br /><br />My baby is not a picky eater at all, so I can't comment on the taste of it.<br /><br />Update:  My baby is now 7 months and takes about 16-18 oz of formula a day.  We noticed that she had been spitting up a lot since increasing her feedings, she would spit up without fail after a feeding, not matter how well she was burped and she would spit up again, sometimes 3 more times in the next hour.  When I happened to run out of this brand and had to use some similac, the spitting up nearly disappeared.  If I had to guess it's due to all the foam in the bottle, but perhaps it's one of the ingredients?  As I mentioned in the above review, the amount of shaking that has to be done to dissolve the formula is ridiculous.  Even with very warm water and a lot of shaking we'll have lumps of undissolved formula in the bottom of the bottle.  I am very disappointed because the price is right and it's one of only 2 options of organic formula that isn't full of arsenic.  Unfortunately a new shipment of 4 of these canisters arrived after realizing this, so we're stuck with it.  But I think I will mix it with another formula to minimize the spitting up.","If there was a better option for the price, I'd take it."
"summarize: I got a few bottles from a friend that ordered it, I freely admit its a good tasting bottle of water. The problem for me is the price point, I am fully aware that its cheaper than most energy drinks of a similar nature, but I don't drink energy drinks solely for the caffeine, there are a host of added flavors and supplements to choose from. This bottled element water while a good tasting alternative is still to put bluntly, a small bottle of water, you could buy a gallon of ""decent"" tasting water at any local store for less.<br /><br />I like the free shipping, but ultimately the cost is just shifted into the base price of the water. This is something I'd definitively buy in a local store if the price per bottle were able to go down, considering the overhead cost a store would bring I don't see that being overly likely anytime soon. Good product, but i'm not in love with the cost.","Good clean tasting water, price point might be a little high."
"summarize: These K-Cups make a good cup of coffee. As others have said in the reviews, it is stronger than what I would expect from a ""Medium."" I make these on the largest cup size on the Keurig, and it is still a little strong. However, you can tell that it is Starbucks (even if not quite as good as the in-store coffee).<br /><br />I didn't want to comment on the price of these, but as others have pointed out, they are a bit on the expensive side. However, if you drink Starbucks regularly, you should expect that, and it is still cheaper and more convenient than going to the Starbucks.<br /><br />I would recommend borrowing one of these from someone else or buying a small box of them to make sure you like it, before you buy the bulk package.  But if worst comes to worse, I believe they can be made drinkable (or at least you will be able to find someone else that will drink it, unlike other K-Cups that I have tried, which I could not even give away).","Good, but Strong Cup of Coffee"
"summarize: Lipton Yellow Label is CTC (crush, tear, curl) processed black Indian tea. Lipton makes it for the UK and India markets where folks take their tea with milk and sugar. CTC tea looks a little like coarse coffee grounds, and it brews quickly into a dark robust liquor that can stand up to milk and sugar. Some tea drinkers say the process gains heartiness, but at the cost subtlety and perfume.<br />  CTC makes a stronger brew than leaf tea or (ewww) tea bags. Start with ¾ tsp of Yellow Label per cup, and steep for just three minutes, and adjust to taste next time. I find a second extraction (six-minute steep) to be quite drinkable. Again, a matter of taste.<br />  I settled on Yellow Label for my daily cuppa after trying several kinds of leaf tea over the years. I also tried Tetley, another CTC blend, but found it one-dimensional and heavy. Single-estate leaf teas still delight my Inner Tea Snob, but their cost makes them occasional treats, not daily tipples.<br />  And it's on the scale of value for money where Yellow Label is a clear winner. I know of no other tea in its price range that tastes as good. Yes, you can find teas that offer more complexity, subtlety and bouquet - for a lot more money.<br />  If you're looking for a daily cuppa that delivers real tea satisfaction for just pennies a cup, it's hard to go wrong with Yellow Label. Start with the one-lb box (about $11). Two two-lb boxes ($35) are even better value, but that's a year's worth of tea in my house.",The most bang for the buck for your daily cuppa
"summarize: ""Silky"" is the word I kept coming back to as I tried this chocolate.  It's smooth, rich, and ... well, ""silky"" is just the right word.  Everything about this chocolate is decadent, but also feel-good insofar as it bears the 'organic' and 'rainforest certified.'  What does this mean in a practical sense to consumers?  From the Newman's Own site: ""The USDA Organic Seal assures that at least 95% of the ingredients are organically certified."" and ""The Rainforest Alliance Certified(tm) seal guarantees that the cocoa in our Signature Series was grown on farms that meet comprehensive standards for sustainable farming, protecting soil, waterways and wildlife habitat as well as the rights and welfare of workers, their families and communities.""<br /><br />Seals and certifications don't mean much in the mouth, however, and that's where this chocolate excels.  It's rich without being excessively bitter.  Smooth without lacking depth and substance.  It's easy to eat (and that comes from someone who struggles with chocolate, at times), and it's a very accessible dark chocolate.  A very adult alternative to the over-sweet milk chocolate one might find in a more pedestrian alternative.<br /><br />I don't know how better to celebrate this product than to just list the ingredients: Organic Dark Chocolate (organic evaporated cane juice, organic chocolate liquor, organic cocoa butter, organic soy lecithin, and organic vanilla).  This stuff is as feel-good as it is taste-good.  Can't wait to try the other varieties.","Rich, decadent, silky, and 'feel-good' in content, origin, and manufacture."
"summarize: Earlier today I was on the phone with my sister and the new puppy I bought her for Christmas decided to make and unplanned and unauthorized solid deposit on her wool rug. Since my gift had now left her a ""gift"" I felt pretty bad about the rug. She was very gracious about the matter though. While we were still on the line, I was surprised how quickly she was able to clean up the mess, *so* quickly I had to ask just HOW she had managed to do so. She said it was this Rescue Clean Sweep Accident Absorbent, a product I had never heard of. I have both a cat and a dog so this definitely interested me and I asked a few more questions.<br /><br />It's made of a single ingredient - perlite which is a natural, highly absorbent substance, widely used in the gardening industry. It's the little white granules you see in potting soil; it's in there because it absorbs water readily and then can return it back to the plant as needed when the soil becomes dry. By nature it can absorb the moisture from both wet and solid pet messes and make it easy to just sweep it up into a dustpan. It works quickly and within just a few minutes while we chatted on the phone she was able to get the entire mess off the rug.<br /><br />I'm glad she found this product and also glad she told me about it because after hearing how well this product works I think it's definitely one of those things for me to keep in the cleaning cupboard for ""just in case"".",saved me and puppy from being in the doghouse
"summarize: I've been on a quest, as many popcorn lovers are, for a topping that tastes like movie theater ""butter."" I've tried several, including real, clarified butter I've melted myself, but this topping from Odells is the best yet. I ordered the three-pack, and got it today. We popped a batch of Amish baby white in our Whirly-Pop using coconut oil and popcorn salt (the famous yellow kind, name slips my mind), then melted a scant two tablespoons of this concentrated butter to pour over the top. There was no artificial oiliness or orange dye, just a very nice, natural buttery feel and taste. That small amount of topping barely made a dent in the 10-oz tub, yet it was more than enough for an entire large bowl. The two of us ate it clear down to the last kernel - it was that delicious.","Closest you can get to movie theater taste, and it's REAL"

"summarize: I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy, but don't let that scare you off.  I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured ""food"" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.",Forget Molecular Gastronomy - this stuff rockes a coffee creamer!
"summarize: Tabasco is an important staple in Louisiana and Texas pantries.  We like it on scrambled eggs for breakfast.  When we have barbecued pork sandwiches for lunch, we like them extra hot; so we sprinkle on some Tabasco.  Many of our restaurants have bottles of it on the table with the salt and pepper.<br /><br />Tabasco is a natural with collard greens.

"summarize: This GREEN Habanero sauce is quite potent. Two or three drops is all you'll need for a bloody mary and only a few more drops will add considerable heat to any family sized dish.<br /><br />The Habanero chile is one of the hottest chiles known to man and in its immature state its color is green. So these younger chiles are slightly less hot than then the older red ones.<br /><br />This is a pure heat source with little if any other flavor beyond the overwhelming heat. If you really think hard about this sauce you might (?) be able to detect a vague hint of vinegar (which is the Acetic Acid listed in the ingredients).<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): Water, Habanero Pepper, Salt, Acetic Acid (a chemical component of vinegar), .... etc<br /><br />Conclusion: There is nothing special about this sauce beyond its considerable and concentrated heat. While there are some very vague vinegar notes (from the Acetic Acid) -  there is no real character to this sauce beyond pure heat.<br /><br />Yet that my be all you want. A potent heat source and this one certainly meets that mark!<br /><br />If you decide to order this sauce --- Watch the seller's shipping charges which can often be excessive and won't drop even if you order multiple bottles at the same time.<br /><br />I'd pass on this hot sauce because of its lack of character - 3 stars is about right. But if you are looking for just pure heat then give it 3 or 4 stars or even 5 stars.<br /><br />If you want even more heat then look for a Habanero sauce that does not list water as its first (therefore major) ingredient. There are other Habanero sauces which are even hotter but I'll confess I'm not a big fan of tasteless but ultra hot chile sauces.<br /><br />Tastes do differ so you may want to try this one. In all fairness I gave it three stars because it offered pure heat without any obvious flaws.",Quite Hot -  If you want pure heat this may be you your sauce.

"summarize: I absolutely adore chocolate chip cookies, especially soft ones with lots of opportunities to nibble.  These new Chips Ahoy cookies are so yummy!  They're soft, with lots of chocolate chips and a fun, fudgy center.  When I got a box, I immediately opened it and doled out portions for the family into separate plastic bags, because I knew I'd be tempted to each everyone else's share!  My share quickly disappeared, and I am now poised to go do a long, cardio-heavy workout to burn off all this sugar and fat.  As much as I love these cookies, they're NOT for every day, and especially not if you want to slim down!<br /><br />If you do purchase these through Amazon, I would recommend putting them in the fridge if they've been exposed to high temperatures, such as in the summer while they're out in the USPS delivery truck.  I can imagine the center fudge could easily melt and create a big mess.  Time in the fridge would solidify these right up.<br /><br />My only criticism would be with the price-- it seems a little high for only 18 cookies.  A family of four would go through a box in no time flat, for sure.<br /><br />But overall-- tastes great, don't have it every day, and be sure to burn off the calories!","So yummy-- a nibbler's dream, but pricey on calories and $"
"summarize: Ordered directly from PetFoodDirect before I saw the negative reviews here.  So after delivery, I decided I would make the transition slowly.  A week and a half later, I was feeding approx half old and half new, and one of the dogs started vomiting/had diarrhea, had no appetite, and was lethargic.  I'm switching him to a plain chicken and rice diet, but if he doesn't get better soon, I'll have to take him to the vet.<br /><br />Other dog must have an iron constitution because she seems fine.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Took the sick dog to the vet.

This is by far the best mix out there for chocolate chip cookies, it has the right texture, it doesn't taste artificial in any way and the combination of brown sugar and butter along with the ghirardelli chips is fantastic.  I don't even make them from scratch because this is just as good and easier (at least to me) and I always get compliments on them when I bake some up to share.

"summarize: When I was much younger I actually popped popcorn for a living! I did this job for United Artists and General Cinema. When this oil first hit my hot pan the smell of it uncovered surprisingly intense memories of that crazy high school job working with my friends. Beyond the smell, the oil performed very well - it was easy to get consistent batches of popcorn without being too fiddly with temperature, timing, or other problematic issues typical of making movie theater popcorn without movie theater equipment.<br /><br />This oil solidifies when it gets cold, and in our use on a camping trip I did have to immerse the container in some warm water to loosen it up - which unfortunately misshaped the plastic container, but I understand if anyone out there sees this as a fringe issue.<br /><br />On quantity, I popped about 12 pounds of popcorn with 3 of the 16-oz jars. Your mileage may vary, but ordering these small containers is a much better deal than getting a gallon of oil that will just sit around.<br /><br />All around, I highly recommend this product and will order it again.","Just like in the movie theater, and I should know!"

My sister just switched her dog to it this summer, because he was having some stomach issues; she thought a new dog food might be a good idea.

She was feeding <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDEI6W"">Purina One Chicken & Rice Dog Food, 4-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, which is an excellent dog food, with meat as the first ingredient.

"summarize: These add a creamy, thick chocolately flavor to almost anything but once in a while I experience a very strange aftertaste with the chocolate flavor,usually when I use 2 vs just one in my beverage.<br /><br />The packaging, however, leaves a lot to be desired and unless you want a lot of work when this arrives, you might want to rethink this purchase. In recent weeks, I've purchased 3 cases of this product (that is 12 boxes of 50 single serve cups) in 3 flavors for the local emergency shelter here in Western, MA due to the tornadoes that ripped through my community and those of my family and friends. I am so thankful I looked at this product before just bringing it to the make-shift kitchens and coffee setups on the back of pickup trucks.  This is what I experienced. What follows is actually my 'cut and paste' comments from one of my 'leave packaging comments' for Amazon, so it lists 2 cases vs 3. I purchased 1 first, then had second thoughts and went back and bought the additional 2 flavors (creamy chocolate, cinnamon vanilla (excellent flavor, by the way) and Irish Cream (a bit too subtle in flavor for me-could have a bit more oomph). As such, you'll see me refer to just 2 below.<br /><br />Exterior shipping box was fine and interior 'case' holding product perfectly intact. However, contents (50 in each)are a sticky, gooey, unusable mess. I purchased 2 flavors/2 cases = 8 cartons = 400 of this product and all 8 cartons are a disgusting disappointment. While the majority of the single serve cups are fine, a large handful in every one of the 50-pack boxes are squished, cracked or just ripped open. Contents spilled over the rest of the single serve cups throughout the boxes that are now slimy, sticky and tacky, with what looks like dried and/or tacky curdled milk all over them. I had to throw away 46 cups total and wash every other single serve cup by hand and then find another container to hold them all. I sure won't be buying these again.","Thick, creamy (be sure to shake well), nice for a change"
"summarize: I bought a case of all three products, Inka, Pero and Cafix in order to compare them. Honestly? They are all the same, so go with whatever is the cheapest. I think I did like Cafix the best, but it may be a mental thing with the name at least sounding somewhat like Coffee. There is little difference in all three, they look identical with only tiny coloration differences. All by themselves they do not taste like coffee and if you are a black coffee drinker? Pass, because you will not be satisfied with the taste. It is very bland all by itself. BUT, if you like cream in your coffee? You won't even notice the difference between coffee and these products within a week or two you will forget you are not drinking coffee.

But, i think you cannot go wrong with a stove top moka of this stuff.  it is not bitter, it is not sour, it has no off notes-- just extremely rich and heady, a good hefty body and smoothness that can't be beat.  the outrageously excellent aroma permeates the house like a great coffee shop you might step into.<br /><br />i read some of the bad reviews, and i can't understand the negative comments, just as they can't understand the good reviews--taste is individual i guess!  But, i LOVE this coffee!  it's extremely good, and i will even drink it late in the evening despite the caffeine, due to the wonderful flavor. crazily, i find myself looking forward to a quiet weekend morning to indulge, just like you might see on some goofy ad where a woman with closed eyes is smiling in dreamy wonder while sniffing a cup. try this coffee- maybe you'll be lucky to be in the majority for whom this rings all the bells.<br /><br />update: i tried the Lavazza in the Keurig, and it just does not do it justice in comparison to the stove-top moka method. but, it still tastes better than regular k-cups.<br /><br />update 2: i tried this in the Aeropress (french drip type) machine that had over 1000 great reviews here on Amazon, and i have to say, this combo will be my only go-to coffee from now on.  the Aeropress, in addition to being easier to use than stove top, seems to make a less burnt flavored and more creamy brew.  this, combined with condensed sweetened milk (like the Vietnam-french drip type)is heavenly. i'm buying a second Aeropress to have this combo at home in addition to the office.",fancy coffee shop taste and smell

"summarize: Only reason I give it 4 stars is because someone was right, there are ALOT of hard stems/sticks in this product but maybe I just have been buying catnip without stems in it for a while.  Maybe this means it is fresh and all natural too.  I saw lots of buds which was good.  I removed as many sticks/stems as I could and gave it to my cats.  They seemed to really like it alot.  They didn't go crazy nutty cuckoo but who knows, maybe tomorrow they will!  I bought it mainly for their digestion and it seemed to calm them and relax them which I liked.

"summarize: I ordered the Breadman TR-875 the other day when it was a Gold Deal.  I have never used a bread machine nor made bread.  I read the reviews for the Breadman and discovered the Hodgson Mill, referenced by a Breadman reviewer.  While my Breadman was being prepared for shipment, I ordered a case of 9-Grain.  They both arrived the same day and I spent the evening discovering the Breadman.  The next morning with trepidation I ventured forth to make my first loaf of bread, and posted a picture here and for the Breadman. I cut the heel and had soon eaten almost half the loaf.  It is fabulous.  The way that bread is intended by Mother Nature.  Today I just completed making the other five loaves.  Every loaf was perfection - Six of Six.

"summarize: I tried both this & the CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil in the squirt bottle. The liquid in the squirt bottle worked far better on my hair, was FAR less messy & easier to apply.<br /><br />This product seemed to feel heavier & weighted down my hair much more, giving it a ""just out of the pool"" look... shiny, but weighted down.<br /><br />If you use this, use VERY little! Although it's hard to do unless you let it warm up & liquefy a bit before using, then you might as well get the lighter, liquid, easier to control formula.<br /><br />Might be OK for an occasional VERY deep treatment, although mayonnaise or oils that you'd eat cost less & are far less messy out of a squirt bottle, which the other product has.<br /><br />Would likely be better for people with thicker strand, very curly hair (afro-american or similar), yet too heavy for my hair.<br /><br />1st two (2) ingredients are petro products, so not my favorite treatment. Has some great ingredients, yet are further down the ingredient list, meaning there is less of them. The liquid hair oil has mineral oil as the 1st ingredient as well, but works well.<br /><br />If you want real natural oils for your hair, I'd suggest food or USP-grade plant oils, such as avocado, sunflower, shea, cocoa butter, palm ""oil""(one of my favorites-the semi-solid kind seems to work best on my hair, yet everyone's hair is different,and has different needs, so try different ones out until you find what works best for you) & similar oils/plant materials (some are hard & need to be warmed to use.) Add some vitamin E oil (natural is d-alpha, dl-alpha is made in a lab) & honey can help (& smells nice) as well, although I wouldn't leave it in your hair - give it a good rinse.<br /><br />If you're looking for something to grab quick that does a great job & don't mind the mineral oil, have dry, thinner hair that breaks easy, I'd get the squirt bottle instead here http://www.amazon.com/CLEAR-SCALP-BEAUTY-THERAPY-Nourishing/dp/B007RTR9G0/ref=pd_sbs_bt_1 It works great & is far easier to use.<br /><br />I'm going to keep this for once in a while deep treatment, but for a couple of times a week,this is probably best reserved for afro-american hair & even then, use sparingly.",Messy to use.

summarize: Live in Florida and bought 4 of these traps based on the reviews here. This trap seems rather large for the size moles we have here in Florida. The tunnels which I could find are no bigger than 1 inch. The soil is so sandy that the trigger gets covered up and the tunnels collapse when trying to set this trap. I did as suggested and leveled the fist size mounds to see where the active tunnels were which showed up the next day. Not one trap went off.<br />As far as placing the trap with the trigger above the ground (as suggested by some reviewers here) this makes no sense as the tunnels are NOT RAISED and there is no way the trap will go off. The traps were placed with the trigger in the tunnel so the moles would go under it and trigger the trap.<br />Anyone living in a hot sandy soil area who has found a trap that will work please post.,Does not work in sandy soil
"summarize: Vitamin Squeeze is promoted as an energy drink, but folks, let me tell you, I drink it at 8pm and I'm out like a light by 9pm......and this from a guy who usually sleeps 4-5/night and a cup of coffee keeps me awake for easily 24+ hours! So, minus one star for no energy....I would give it a star for letting me sleep MORE, but that's not how it's advertised. ;-) With that said, I find the taste to be very good. I need to drink a lot for several reasons, and this makesthe water taste much better. I don't really taste a bad after taste, but there is something (I just don't mind it). As for the squeeze being the perfect amount....hmmmm....I don't see how that is as I control the squeeze, and I can squeeze longer or shorter and different amounts come out each time. Either way, it is a good taste and not over the top. I don't need a lot to give my water bottle a better taste. This is 3.5 stars for me, just not enough to bump it to 4....mainly because it doesn't live up to it's energy status and the ""squeeze,"" is in no way accurate. If you are looking for something to flavor your water, this is it....just don't think it will energize you.","Tastes good, but didn't energize me."
"summarize: I already wrote a review for the chocolate chip ones, though I thought I was writing it for this flavor, so I will just copy and paste. THe both taste good.<br /><br />I bought these bars as a meal replacement, since I am usually hungry about 4 hours after I had lunch, or 2-3 hours after breakfast, so I have to survive before the next meal. This does the job well. I can stay without eating for another 2-3 hours. It also depends how much water you drink, sometimes all you need is water to get rid of the ""hunger"". It's the way your body tells you you need water as well.<br /><br />My stomach is somewhat sensible and doesn't like a lot of stuff, but these bars never bother me.<br /><br />I also think they are tasty, but only the chocolate ones. I tried the strawberry ones, but they are too creamy. I also liked the chocolate chip ones, they both taste similar, though the chocolate chip ones have more fiber than these ones :P","good product, satisfies my hunger :)"
"summarize: We've found so many ways to enjoy these Sun-Dried Tomato sausages - for us they've proved to be the most versatile of all the Aidells sausages we've tried.<br /><br />  They're a nice complemnt to breakfast eggs or pancakes because while the flavor is tasty it is still mild enough  not to do battle with eggs.  The bits of  tomato add a freshness that is very nice in  the a.m.<br /><br />  Many of  our pasta dishes have been topped with this sausage, which again blends so well with whatever other additions to the sauce whether  it be anchovies or zesty seasonings.  It's  lovely with  our favorite bean soup as well as a favorite chicken soup.<br /><br />  We especially appreciate Aidells including the recipe for Pasta with Sun-Dried Tomato with  Mozzarella Cheese Sausage on the inside of the package wrap.

"summarize: The new packaging is very appealing with this Dentyne gum. I like that you have the ability to break the standard package in half and carry around a smaller portion. This is nice for someone (like my husband) who doesn't want to put a large pack of gum in his pocket, or myself not wanting to carry a full size pack of gum in a small purse. I don't care for the fact that the packaging lacks the ability to conveniently dispose of your used gum in a wrapper like most other gums, but that's just the way of Dentyne gums. You have to find a tissue of a piece of paper if you're not near a trash can ;-) Otherwise, the Peppermint is by far my favorite flavor. I also reviewed the Arctic Chill, which is much too strong...I would not recommend it! But the peppermint is a nice flavor. Still strong, but not overwhelming. Like the other reviewer, I was fortunate to test this product, and found the Peppermint to be something I would definitely be purchasing in the future!","I like the new packaging, the flavor is OK!"

"summarize: I have been using this product religiously for the past decade, after becoming a vegan and experimenting with flax seed goop, pureed silken tofu, mashed bananas--all of the egg replacement staples.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why so many vegans dislike this product.  It's always turned out perfect baked goods for me, in both taste and texture, is inexpensive, and doesn't lend the icky flavor of flax or silken tofu to your baked goods. It's just neutral, and helps the baked good bind and rise, as egg would.  I've made everything from brownies to decadent cakes to cookies to muffins to airy fluffy biscuits with this, and it's all been highly praised (often without realizing the goods are vegan) by omnivore, egg-eating relatives and friends who have begged me for years to open my own bakery.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the general complaints I hear all too frequently are about.  As I hope I've made clear, this product works perfectly for me.  Here are some of my tips for using this product: 1) use a liquid that's already in the recipe (eg soymilk) to blend your powder. 2) always always ALWAYS do your best to get all of the lumps out of your liquid+powder mixture.  I blend mine in a small bowl or ramekin (depending how much Ener-G Egg Replacer I'm using) with a fork or tiny single egg beater.  If the mixture still has tons of lumps, it's not going to do its job.  But when it doesn't have lumps, it works perfectly!  3) I always use about one egg's worth more of Ener-G than the recipe calls for. Just to be safe.  4) Consider adding about a half tablespoon per egg replaced of oil to make up for the lost fat content.<br /><br />Good luck, and please give this product a try!  It's truly excellent.",Simply the best way to eliminate eggs from baking.
"summarize: I could not disagree more with the previous reviewer.  Stash Earl Grey tea is my gold standard.  I've regularly used many different brands -- including some of the ""subtle"" kinds that the previous reviewer favors -- and nothing compares with the bloom and fragrance of the Stash.  The others are either too ""orangey"" or too tepid (although much more expensive).  If Earl Grey tea is worth drinking over the many weak-flavored imitations and other black teas out there, then Stash is the only choice.  I've used it for more than 20 years, and I always keep coming back to it after flirting with other teas, because it is of the highest quality and consistency at the most reasonable price.

"summarize: I have highlighted hair, fairly short, and also dry.  This Ultra Shea shampoo works wonders on it.<br /><br />One thing I especially like, because I tried the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8A2"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>, is that the Ultra Shea shampoo has a very mild, almost vanilly scent to it.

(Fabaceae) is traditionally used as a ""tea"" referred to as rooibos or redbush. This plant has been listed as a medicinal plant based mostly on anecdotal evidence.<br />AIMS OF THE STUDY:<br /><br />Despite a long history of traditional use in South Africa, very little scientific data are available from controlled clinical trials confirming its popular use. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of rooibos on biochemical and oxidative stress parameters in adults at risk for cardiovascular disease.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS:<br /><br />After a washout period of 2 weeks, 40 volunteers consumed six cups of fermented/traditional rooibos daily for 6 weeks, followed by a control period. Blood biochemical parameters indicative of antioxidant activity and content (total polyphenols), lipid peroxidation (conjugated dienes - CDs, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances - TBARS), redox status (total glutathione - tGSH, ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione - GSH:GSSG), lipid profile (total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein - LDL and high density lipoprotein - HDL cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels) and liver and kidney function were measured at the end of each study period.<br />RESULTS:<br /><br />Plasma antioxidant capacity was not altered, but plasma total polyphenol levels increased significantly after rooibos consumption compared with the control levels (from 79.8±16.9 mg/L to 89.8±14.1 mg/L). Significant decreases in plasma markers of lipid peroxidation were found after rooibos consumption, as reported by levels of CDs (167.3±29.5 nmol/mL vs. 108.8±20.1 nmol/mL) and TBARS (1.9±0.6 'mol/L vs. 0.9±0.3 'mol/L). Reduced glutathione (797±238 'mol/L vs. 1082±140 'mol/L) and the GSH:GSSG ratio (41±14 vs. 76±17) were both significantly increased after consumption of rooibos. The lipid profiles showed that rooibos consumption, compared with the control values, significantly decreased serum LDL-cholesterol (4.6±1.3 mmol/L vs. 3.9±0.7 mmol/L) and triacylglycerols (1.7±0.8 mmol/L vs. 1.2±0.7 mmol/L), while HDL-cholesterol (0.9±0.1 mmol/L vs. 1.2±0.2 mmol/L) was significantly increased.<br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />Confirming its popular use, consumption of fermented, traditional rooibos significantly improved the lipid profile as well as redox status, both relevant to heart disease, in adults at risk for developing cardiovascular disease.<br /><br />Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Most Americans will find this chocolate too bitter for their taste, at only 5g sugar per half bar serving.

"summarize: After many years of eating Quaker Oats, I purchased McCann's and haven't looked back. I didn't know such a modest dish could taste so incredibly good. On Sunday nights I use the short cut method (on the side of the can)which requires one minute of cooking and then storage in the fridge until the following morning. I cook a medium pot which lasts us all week. Just heat them up for about 10 minutes on low (or microwave on medium high) and you have the best oatmeal on the planet. I frequently charge it up with dried cranberries, fresh frozen blueberries, strawberries, chunks of apple and cinnamon and even chopped nuts, sunflower seeds and ground flax seeds. This oatmeal is not mushy but neither is it hard. The texture is chewy and the flavor is awesome. My husband and I are hooked and keep our cupboard well stocked with this healthy breakfast food.

This flavor variety, though, is horrible, judging by the packet I was sent.<br /><br />I opened the package, and they smelled exactly like (forgive the imagery) diarrhea.  And strongly.  I thought someone had had an accident until I realized where it was coming from.<br /><br />I thought maybe it was a flavor dogs like. You never know.  Some cheese smells bad too.  My poor dog spit it out and gagged when I fed it to him.<br /><br />This is either a very misguided flavor attempt, or the completely sealed package somehow went rotten (not a good sign), or they filled it with rotten product at the packaging stage (also not reassuring).<br /><br />Sickening, horrible, unfit to be put in the trash.

"summarize: Oh, egg nog. When Red Leaf Tea first contacted me, asking what flavors of matcha I'd be interested in trying, my immediate response was this. Egg nog. Oh goodness, egg nog. Please, oh please, egg nog. When the holidays come around, I miss it with a burning passion. There's just too much cream in it for it to be worth the risk, unfortunately. We have been able to find soy nog, but it's just not the same. But I have to say, it does the trick when I'm really just dying for a cup of nog. It certainly brought my father in law and me closer last Christmas when he was always more than happy to get me a glass of soy nog so he had an excuse to grate fresh nutmeg on top. He cracks me up.<br /><br />So this matcha had high, high, high expectations to live up to. It was delicious, very much so, but a little weak. I got a hint of eggnog flavor that was greatly overshadowed by the flavor of the matcha. Which isn't a bad flavor at all, it just isn't what I want when I drink egg nog. Maybe a little soy milk will bring out that creaminess for me and give me that egg nog flavor I crave.",Nog Nog Noggin' on heaven's door....
"summarize: As my baby approaches the stage at which we can introduce solids to her diet, I started doing my research on organic, prepared baby foods.  I was all set to make Earth's Best my brand of choice, since we already use some of their other products (e.g., baby wipes).  But that was until I discovered that the covers of their glass jars contain bisphenol-A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor that can cause negative health effects, especially in vulnerable infants and young children.  Apparently, Earth's Best claims that its jarred baby food has been independently-tested, and found to have undetectable levels of BPA.  However, I'm still skeptical.  In a ""perfect lab"" setting with a pristine jar of baby food, the BPA may not have had the opportunity to leach from the cover into the baby food.  But in the real world, by the time that jar of baby food reaches the average consumer, it has been turned upside-down and shaken up in the process of packing, shipping, unpacking, shelving, etc.  Plus, many parents warm up their baby food in the jars; and I've heard that heating can increase/speed-up the BPA leaching process.  SCARY STUFF!!  I don't see why Earth's Best doesn't just play it safe and line their baby food jar covers with a resin that doesn't contain BPA.  It's honestly not that hard to do ... Just ask Eden Organics!  The linings of many of their canned vegetables are BPA-free.  Sure, it might increase the cost of the baby food by a bit, but I'm sure I speak for many parents when I say that I'd be willing to pay a little extra just for the peace of mind of knowing that there are no harmful chemicals in my baby's food.  After all, we're willing to spend a bit more for organic baby food to begin with.<br /><br />Earth's Best also makes baby food in BPA-free pouches.  But, to be honest, the company's refusal to acknowledge and correct the problem of BPA in its jar covers has left me with a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended).  So I may just take my ""baby-food-business"" elsewhere.",Jar lids contain BPA ... So disappointing!
"summarize: The base of the tree was thicker than the one shown in the picture.  The I received has a nice taper.  A nice touch, there was a little bit of moss growing over the dirt.<br /><br />The tree came packaged in a tall box with an inner Styrofoam base to protect the pot.  The pot and base of the tree were wrapped tight in a thick plastic and the soil was damp upon arrival.  The rest of the space inside the box was filled with a biodegradable type of foam peanuts (watch out, they get everywhere when you take the tree out).<br /><br />Fantastic tree!","Fabulous, even better than the example picture"
"summarize: This has become my everyday tea.  I have experimented with many different types of tea over the past 2 years since I became a loose tea addict.  I don't know all of the official tea drinker's lingo but I will do my best.  The Ceylon Supreme is the nicely balanced tea I was looking for for.  It is smooth but still has a light astringency or brightness to it without being bitter.  This is what I drink now instead of coffee.  It is great hot, cold or at room temperature.  I still buy and try other teas such as Oolongs and flavored teas for occasional drinking but I recommend this one for the morning brew.  I also like the metal container.  The double lid keeps the tea fresh and stays closed so that it is good for traveling.",Dilmah Ceylon Supreme is My Everyday Tea
"summarize: I think not!<br /><br />OF course it is great for all the things people have mentioned, but I have found it particularly wonderful as a facial CLEANSER.  I massage a good bit of the oil over my face and neck, let it sit for a few minutes while I brush my teeth etc., then I take a warm wet cloth and wipe my face.  The excess oil comes off with all the dirt and makeup that was on my face (even the water proof mascara) and it leaves a nice light film of oil that makes my face glow, and for ONCE in my life I'm free of blemishes, even during those particularly difficult times of month! I'm in love!  Next time I'll be ordering a gallon size!",Is there anything you can't use this oil for?
"summarize: We are a healthy household but enjoy the occasional Soda, the compromise for my hubby to have soda with lunch daily is only if it's Organic Blue Sky it only has a few ingredients and nothing artificial.  We can get it locally but it is expensive we did some research for the best price...Amazon is our go to for everything and they were the best price for this as well.  We have it on Auto delivery so we get an extra discount and the only way we would order it online is if we got free shipping other wise the shipping is as much as the product, through this link you have the option of free shipping over $25 so we get two cases at once with free shipping.  We're never disappointed with Blue Sky!",Best Organic Soda and Price on Amazon!
"summarize: I love the Nativa brand, however, they always seem to leave out very important details on their packaging.<br /><br />I heard so many praises about how much better the Chia seeds are than Flax seeds.<br /><br />Upon arrival I opted to use these in my salad as opposed to the flax seeds I've been using.<br /><br />The Chia seeds caused the most horrible and painful bloating I ever experienced. Granted, I did use the full serving size, but since then I lowered the amount and STILL with even just a quarter of a teaspoon or less I get the bloating.<br /><br />I have since switched back to the Flax seeds which didn't wreak havoc on my intestinal tract.<br /><br />I am hoping I can find some way to use these seeds in the future because I hate seeing anything go to waste.<br /><br />My advice if you are set on trying the Chia seeds is to start out with a very low amount!!! And stick with that low amount until your stomach builds up a tolerance for these seeds.",HOLY BLOATING! Dont use too much in one meal!
"summarize: My trout roe arrived today and upon opening i was very excited by the beautiful light orange pearls packed in the tin.  With my first spoonful, i was a bit dissapointed in how tough the outer 'membranes' of the roe were.  they just kind of slip around in your mouth and are difficult to ""pop"" using your teeth.  even pinching them between your fingers, you need to apply considerable pressure.  Flavor was nice - similar to salmon roe, but a bit less briney and milder. they seem like fine quality, but the firm texture is very different from salmon roe, which in my experience pop in your mouth a lot easier.  i would say salmon roe is my preferred ""red caviar.""","Nice flavor, but difficult to 'pop' in your mouth"
summarize: This cereal is real good. It is very crunchy and has tiny pieces of nuts and a hint of honey. They taste somewhat like honey nut cheerios but these will not get soggy as fast as the cheerios. They are probably as crunchy or more like apple jacks. I eat slow and by the time I finish the last bite is still crunchy. My favorite part of the cereal is the actual nut pieces on the cereal. It gives it that real nut flavor and bite. The nut flavor is not overwhelming either. Nor is the honey. It is a great balance between the two. If you like honey nut cheerios and the crunchiness of apple jacks then you will really like this cereal.,Very crunchy with real nut pieces!
"summarize: I thought the coffee had a slight bitter taste to it, not what I would call smooth or robust. Not sure on the process they use to create a low acid coffee but this could be the result of the bitterness. Honestly I didn't think there was any difference between the organic decaf coffee I drink now and this low acid coffee, neither caused any acidic build up in my body. Given the price and somewhat wasteful packaging, I'm going to stick with my organic decaf that I get from a local roaster in town. Just disappointed about the taste being sacrificed.","Low Acid Coffee, lack robust favor"
"summarize: I tried these noodles after the numerous recommendations made by the website HungryGirl, but I must say that these noodles are the MOST disgusting thing I have ever eaten.  If you want to get these noodles, I highly suggest you get one pack to try before stocking up (as I did), because you will most likely be left with packs of noodles you won't want to eat.  These noodles have the most unbearable smell, and no amount of rinsing and microwaving I did could remove the horrendous stench.  Additionally, they were so oddly chewy and gelatinous that it is difficult to eat them.  You kind of have to knaw on them to get them to break off into bites.  The nutritionals are great, but they are so not worth any calories you save...they taste horrible and you'd wish you'd eaten nothing than waste 40 calories on these noodles!",Most disgusting mistake of my life...
"summarize: I've been using GU for a long time, 10 years or more, and I think it's a wonderful product.  However, I have noticed that when I'm consuming multiple ones during a race and such, they start to taste sweet, which I don't like at all;  the last thing I want when I'm 20 miles into a run is something sweet.  I thought all gels were pretty much the same, but alas, I now know that that's not true.<br /><br />I have recently discovered another product, gel from Hammer Nutrition.  Their flavors are superior (to me anyway), and they're not overwhelmingly loaded with sugar.  Also, after you take one you're not scrambling for the water bottle since they don't leave a syrup consistency in your mouth.  If you're only going to use 1 gel, then GU can fit the bill, but if you're going to consume multiple ones, you might want to look at the gel from Hammer Nutrition.<br /><br />Oh, about the carbs and sugar content.  There are more simple carbs in the GU gels, which means that it brings you up and down much faster.  Hammer gels have a great deal more complex carbs in them (and they're natural), so you don't spike up and drop down fast, meaning that you give your body a consistent supply of energy without the spikes.  This has been a nice change in my training.<br /><br />FYI, the flavors of GU I like are the Mint Chocolate and Vanilla.  For Hammer gels, I like the Huckleberry, Raspberry, and Apple Cinnamon.","GU Rocks, but something else rocks more"
"summarize: OK, I thought this was for balding men. You know, the guys with the bald patch at the top and the frizz around the edges?<br />My boyfriend has a balding issue, and his hair that does grow is coarse and frizzy, and his scalp gets so dry and irritated I thought this was a perfect product for him to try. I use a conditioning balm from biolage that I LOVE, and this, well, looked like it was for guys.<br />So, I handed it to my boyfriend and he said, ""Where are the instructions?"" and low and behold, THERE ARE NONE!<br />Then he gave me a strange look, opened it up, and said, ""It smells good, but I think I am the wrong color to use this."" Then it occurred to me, this is for...well, not white boyfriends of uninformed white girls.<br />He did rub some on his scalp, and all it made him was greasy. Maybe he is the wrong color to use this, but it came with NO instructions at all, and none in the description, so it is not MY fault.",I thought it was for balding men
"summarize: These are really, really tasty, with just the right amount of smoke flavor. I think someone said they are ugly, but really they're not. Plus, they give your brain a great boost, so you feel good after eating them. The smoke flavor was just right for eating over rice, but in sushi (to make unagi rolls), the smoke was too overwhelming. For making unagi rolls, I'd recommend finding something that is not smoked, or they won't taste like sushi anymore.<br /><br />The only thing is they are NOT as pictured. The case arrived, but they were packed in SOYBEAN oil, NOT cottonseed oil as it says in the product description. I called Amazon, and they were great about sending out a replacement, thinking it was just the wrong item shipped. But the new case arrived the same: different color label, and packed in soybean oil. This would not be a big deal for most, but I ordered these SPECIFICALLY because my husband is allergic to soy. I contacted the company (Roland), and the woman I spoke with seemed surprised at the discrepancy and promised to call me back with an answer the next day as to whether these were mislabeled, or if they're really packed in soy. She never called back.<br /><br />So, these are tasty and great, but BUYER BEWARE they are swimming in SOYBEAN OIL. NOT allergy-safe.","Tasty, but NOT as pictured or labeled!"
"summarize: This stuff tastes great as a dip and also as a sauce.  HOWEVER, the people at Amazon do not know how to ship glass containers.  I ordered this and another jarred item by the same company.  The order consisted of 4 jars of each product.  Shipment arrived with 4 jars in one bubble wrap pocket; 4 in another...BUT they put nothing between the jars within the pocket so they were free to crash against each other, which is exactly what happened.  Within one pocket wrap, 1 jar was broken; within the other pocket, 2 jars were broken. WHAT A MESS, not to mention a waste of money because you get no financial relief for poorly wrapped food items.  I contacted Amazon to tell them of this incident via their designated link for shipping problems.  I have heard nothing from them, not even an acknowledgement of my complaint.<br /><br />Yes, I saw a previous review about poor packageing, but assumed Amazon had learned something from that customer's experience and improved their shipping practices; but I was wrong.  So...Great product, but don't buy from Amazon.",Great product; TERRIBLE shipping by Amazon
"summarize: I first ran across this while working on a TV show - it was on the craft service (snack) table.  I had tried other flavors before, but this version was new to me--LOVED IT!<br /><br />Easily on-par with what you might find at a local bistro, at a fraction of the price. This flavor is top-notch,and truly takes just 1.5 minutes to make.<br /><br />The sip-cup is quite handy for a quick pick-me-up or lunch, or you can put the heated contents into a mug or bowl, and perhaps add in a grilled cheese sand made on any number of contact grills ( George Foreman, Wolfgang Puck's Pannini grill...) to truly make this a hearty meal, in a matter of minutes. (like, maybe 5-- thats MY kind of cooking!)<br /><br />For reasons unknown, this particular flavor can sometimes be hard to find, both in regular stores or at Amazon. Seems to sell out frequently.  I like the auto-ship from Amazon, rather than buying single cans at the supermarket.<br /><br />It is also kind of a nice product to send along to college kids and seniors, as well - two groups NOT well known to always eat well.  They would appreciate something like this, trust me.  And, yup, it is available on motion picture and television shoot's, with some VERY picky eater's!<br /><br />This is truly a five star item, and one that I will never be without.  Yum!","This is REALLY great!  Great taste, super fast, Sensational for college kid's, seniors and EVERYONE. Yummy!"
"summarize: the dog loves choo hooves, but often some of them can be odor offensive while she is chewing them.  she also loves to bring one to bed with us, so sometimes that requires the fan to be on in order to send the odor on out the door so as not to linger.  NOT ANY MORE, these smoked hooves are great.  not only does the dog love them more, but they truly smell like a smoldering campfire.  so i watch tv, she chews and i imagine the warmth of a nice smokey fire close by.  no more fans as i LOVE a good campfire.  ooooppppsss... now the neighbor dog is hooked too!!  sharing in the neighborhood.  going to order 3 more bags.  the 'humane society no kill shelter' will love these for the pups on the hill.",LOVE the Campfire AROMA in the living room....
"summarize: The Fresh Stacks are half-sized graham crackers packaged eight half-sized crackers to a stack. This new way of packaging them will presumably keep them fresher because you have fewer crackers in each package so they will sit in the opened package for less time before they're eaten. The taste is the same yummy Honey Maid graham cracker taste as the traditionally sized longer rectangle graham crackers. Interestingly, I checked a package of the traditional long Honey Maid graham crackers and high fructose corn syrup is listed as one of the ingredients but it is not one of the ingredients for the Fresh Stack graham crackers. If you are concerned about limiting HFCS in your diet, the Fresh Stacks are the way to go.",Same great graham cracker taste packaged for freshness
"summarize: One rule I always try to follow is to never go to the grocery store when I'm hungry. Well, I missed on this one tonight. All was well as I visited my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market until I passed the baking chocolates. There sat a tray of Cadbury Crunchie bars. I couldn't help myself. The label said it was made in St. Bournville, Birmingham UK. It was 190 calories, but I'd been good all day. Into the cart a bar went, and I opened it first thing when I got home. Man, was this thing good! The outer chocolate cover was excellent but the best part was a crunchy caramel-like interior. I can't describe it. It tasted a bit like the inside of a Heath Bar, but it was better. It was part solid and part like a really stiff and crunchy foam. Did I mention that it was delicious? Mmmmm! One of the best bars I've had in years. To be honest, I don't consume many candy bars, but this one was certainly excellent!<br /><br />Gary Peterson",One of the Best Bars I've Had in Years!
"summarize: I have been a long-time drinker of the Original Sweet and Spicey tea and was glad to find it in an organic version.  Since kicking the caffeine habit a few years ago, I have been drinking this tea every morning, and I really look forward to it.  But, this version is so much weaker than the original version that it just tastes yucky to me.  I understand that the original version now contains an ""artificial"" ingredient to pump up the taste.  Whatever it is, I'm ok with it because the original version is so much better than this organic version.  It's not worth drinking it if you don't enjoy it.  (If this is the version of the tea you start with, this may be fine for you.  But if you are used to the more flavorful version, you won't like this one.)",Super disappointed with this version of this tea
"summarize: I was so excited to purchase this planter. My cat is only allowed indoors and loves cat grass.  After following the instructions to a tee, I waited the 4 - 6 days as instructed to wait for the grass.  When I went back to check on growth, I saw one or two shoots coming out and a green fuzz all over the soil.  Also, in the window that I had placed the planter to grow, was an influx of flying insects that were not there prior to the introduction of the planter.  The only way those insects could have appeared exactly at the window where the planter was, is if they came from the planter itself.  Needless to say, I threw away the grass and will have to look for other sources.  Incredibly disappointed.",mold and insects grew in my planter
"summarize: I've had this salt before and purchased more 'cause I like it. However, when I opened the box I could smell the fragrance of the product. I found the seal on the jar was broken and the lid was loose. This vendor (Kiva Health Brands LLC) obviously has no compunction about selling a food item with the safety seal compromised; there are two other reviews complaining of the same problem and I can't image how the seal would break in-transit.

"summarize: I have been buying two-pound lots of pistachios from a bulk seller on Amazon.  These are good, but have a fairly high number of ""bad"" nuts (maybe 1 out of 25).<br /><br />I decided to splurge on this brand.  The nuts were much better packaged (in a heavy plastic resealable envelope).  They have a little bit more ""crunch"" to them, and the incidence of ""bad"" nuts is a bit less (maybe 1 out of 40 - but I still need to visually inspect each nut I eat - those little black nuts have a strong and very disagreeable flavor).<br /><br />But I do not feel the extra cost (and higher shipping) is justified by a small improvement in quality.  I will go back to the bulk seller for my next order.",Great pistachios - better than the lower-priced alternatives. But worth the cost???
"summarize: I got this to make milk froth for my Nespresso Pixie. I was using a Dolce Gusto machine for my coffee milk drinks with the powdered milk capsule, but this is better. Since I don't use milk much for other things, this works better with less waste. It also froths better too, with just a hand held frother to rinse. I just use the Nespresso to pour some hot water into a cup with the milk powder and a packet of sweetener, and hit it with the frother. The Black & Decker one works great. Then I do a shot or two of espresso, and an instant capp or latte with no fuss! Tastes as good to me as frothed milk from a fancy machine.",Makes great frothed milk for lattes and capps!
"summarize: I have to say, I love this tea. I didnt know much about the health benefits associated with drinking green tea. Ever since I have been drinking this tea, in the morning before work and after lunch I always feel a sense of calm...much better then my gogo coffee days. I love the fact that its been produced the same way for for over a century. This is a fantastic, aromatic tea for sure. I cant wait to try their loose leaf green tea next! Im hoarding my box of Gorreana tea at work untill I can get some more of this!",Gorreana Tea tastes so fresh and healthy!
"summarize: I purchased one box of this locally so I could try it first, but I'll begin getting it here by the case since it's so delicious! I'm trying to cut back on caffeine/sugar and have been drinking a few cups of coffee daily for years. I can't drink it w/o sugar so I was looking for a tea that would be close enough for me to not feel deprived. This is fantastic!! The flavors are so warm and spicy that I can easily drink it w/o sugar. I add just a splash of vanilla almond milk, and for me, it soothes me in the same way that coffee did, maybe even more so. It's still in the upper 90's here, but sipping this makes me feel like it's cloudy and 55 degrees outside. That feeling alone is worth the price of this tea. Love it!!","Sooooo soothing, tastes and smells like fall!"
"summarize: These dog treats are made in china and are potentially poisonous. They should be avoided at all costs.  My dog is too precious to me to even take the risk.  Chinese people EAT dogs, they don't care about yours.  I urge all consumers to send emails to Milos Kitchen AND Waggin Train and let them know these products are NOT ACCEPTABLE to Americans.  There's no reason why hard-working Americans can't make tasty dog treats, and we would make them with love instead of poison.  I WOULD pay a little more if these treats were American.

"summarize: I feel like I've tried every hot cocoa there is in the k-cups.  While I do think this is the best hot cocoa so far, it still isn't great.  I'm not sure what it is, but all of the cocoa k-cups seem to have a weird taste to them.  It's almost like there is artificial sweetener in them,, but I know there is not.<br />I set it on the smallest cup setting for cocoa.  This has more body to it than others.<br />I'm still waiting and hoping that Dunkin' Donuts will put out their hot cocoa in a k-cup.

"summarize: Ok, my kid is VERY finicky. Things have to be made a certain way, etc. She also has food allergies, which in turn exacerbate her eczema, as well as seriously limiting what she can eat, even healthy stuff. Flax is good for eczema, but she doesn't like it added to cereal, won't do the oil, even when mixed w/maple syrup, etc. Enter these WONDERFUL crackers. Dehydrated at low temps to preserve the oil (& thus all the nutritional benefits), with no artificial colors or flavors, no gluten or other common allergens, etc., so it's the best flax cracker on the market (my opinion). We got some from a local health food store & gave 'em a try. She LOVES them!!! The only thing I don't like is the price, which is why I buy in bulk here @ Amazon. They keep for a long time! We plan to try all the flavors. She doesn't like the Onion n Garlic one (no one does but me - they say too spicy/hot), but I'm betting the Maple Cinnamon will be a hit. Ditto for the 'regular' flavor. Thanks, Amazon, for the great price!",Great Taste! Finicky Eater Loves IT!!!
"summarize: I recently started to drink 2 or more cups of both the red and the green varieties of Davidson's Rooibos teas.  Personally, I like the tastes of both varieties and enjoy drinking the tea, regardless of any consideration of potential health benefits.  For me, the tea requires no additives, which are found in other brands and/or used by other consumers.<br /><br />But taste is such a personal, subjective thing and it is understandable why the Amazon reviews for this product contain such diverse opinions in this regard.  My suggestion is to try the pure form before you make a decision based solely on these reviews to see if you like it or not.","Taste is Subjective, Especially with Different Teas"

Being a foodie myself, I don't really expect my little one to want to eat the same flavors or items every day so knowing I can offer her a variety and great combos like the Banana, Mango and Peach pouch has been a great saving grace since she really likes to try different things almost weekly.  This flavor seems to be her favorite one though as she'll eat this one or ask me via 'sign' for this pouch more then the others.

"summarize: First, Amazon gives you a really good deal on these cans.  The glass bottles that I've seen in stores are 9.5 ounces I think and over $2 each.  So with these being 16.2 ounces each, it's a great deal!  They are still expensive compared to other coconut waters, but there's a reason for that...it's better!<br /><br />I know someone who actually drank from coconuts where she used to live, and says that this stuff tastes better!  I guess Thailand just has some awesome coconuts.  I will say, this is for the AUTHENTIC coconut water drinker.  If you want something more sweet and fruity, try VitaCoco.  They are probably my second favorite and I like their pineapple version a lot.  This, however, is like the taste of a real coconut.  Very hydrating and refreshing!<br /><br />At first, the pulp really threw me off!  Was not expecting it.  But it's actually great once you get used to it, and really adds to the authentic coconut water drinking experience.  This is the best I've tried as far as natural, plain coconut water, and I've tried Amy & Brians, Zico, VitaCoco, and Naked.  Definitely recommend!",Expensive - but there's a reason!  For the authentic coconut drinker.
"summarize: I was first introduced the the Old El Paso Gordita Dinner Kits when I went over to a friend's for dinner back around 2000.  They made chicken they had cubed up added the seasoning etc.  They were fantastic! Since then have been regularly eating these and haven't regretted it one bit!<br /><br />To me the best part of the kit is that it comes with a creamy zesty ranch sauce packet which is tangy and pretty spicy but not too hot.  I even save the packet of the leftover sauce and use it for the next several days on things like nachos.  Yum!<br /><br />The next best part is the gordita shells themselves.  Nice and thick yet soft.  Make sure you warm them up in the microwave first to make them taste and feel better.  We usually throw them in the microwave between paper plates for about 80 seconds at between 30-50% power. Would like it if they were slightly bigger but for most people they are probably the perfect size.  The texture is great.  I always prefer soft shelled tacos and burritos over hard shell tacos, so if you prefer hard shell then this kit may not be for you or buy this in addition to hard shells and have some friends over ;)<br /><br />Sometimes we use ground beef; other times ground turkey; cubed chicken.  All taste great.  We probably have these once or twice a month (4 nights of food when you figure in leftovers) as buying 6 at a time is a commitment but we don't mind.  I think we used to get the 12 pack but then they weren't in stock for a while so we became sad until I recently did another search and came across the Pack of 6.<br /><br />*Another note if you want to save a step and some time:  The instructions say to brown the meat first then add water and the seasoning.  I skip the water and add the seasoning immediately to the meat in the beginning then brown the meat with the seasoning already on it.  I don't notice a difference.  Also recommend using a leaner ground beef to avoid a grease puddle at the bottom of your meat when you are done.",We love these in our house!
"summarize: I can't slight the product.  Anything that contributes to the wealth of 4 or 5 of the richest Americans(the Marz family) can't be bad.  But, you might want to wait until we are past the summer months.  Somehow these babies were overheated when under pressure?<br /><br />OMG, I opened the bag to discover crumbled and re-solidified M&Ms.  Broken chunks and pieces.  Possibly 20% of the individual M&Ms were okay.  The rest were ArM&Mageddon.  Guernica in chocolate & M&M colors.  Shist, geologically that is!  That's  what the chunks remind me of.<br /><br />So, what am I doing?  I'm eating them, 1 to 2 inch chunks at a time.  True, I can't sort my colors and I don't know how many M&M's equal a Chunk. Still they're an exceptional product.  Yum.",ArM&Mageddon in a 56 oz bag.
"summarize: I don't use capers a lot, but when I do, this is the product that I normally use. One of my favorite chicken dishes is chicken piccata. I make it every month or two.<br /><br />With chicken piccata, you have basic ingredients to coat (flour, salt, and pepper) chicken breasts. You fry the breasts in olive oil. Then, remove chicken, add some lemon juice, chicken stock, and capers to the pan drippings, bringing to a boil. Return chicken to the pan and simmer. Remove chicken to the serving plate and pour the sauce over the top. Yummy. And the capers add a really nice touch (by the way, sometimes I add a bit of white wine to the lemon juice, capers, and stock).<br /><br />Anyhow, awfully tasty. The capers add a necessary touch to the entire process. I'm sure that one can easily replace this brand with another and have an equally successful dish. But this is what I use and I'm satisfied.",Great in chicken piccata and other recipes

Well, I've got some that says ""Best by Apr. 27, 2012"" which has probably been in the cabinet for at least two or three years already.<br /><br />It's not something you'll probably want to eat every day (or even every week), but it's great to keep on-hand. Good for natural disasters, power outages, camping, college dorms, financial shortages or times when you just don't feel like cooking anything.<br /><br />One pack is the perfect serving size for a sandwich or to chop up and mix with a can of beans for a filling meal.<br /><br />You can also eat it straight from the package without barfing because it doesn't have a ring of gelatinous goo like its canned counterpart.","Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, SPAM!

Also there are generally 13 rice cakes in a pkg of round regular rice cakes... this package of rice cakes has 27 pieces in each bag. Also, it's much like consuming a slice of bread without the crusts and they are nice and thin so you don't eat too much of a good thing.<br /><br />Try these if you're dissatisfied with regular rice cakes or if you must have gluten free bread!! I don't believe you will be sorry and Amazon's price is so good and FREE shipping... though the box is sort of big, it's pretty light and stores easily away. I live alone and I'm on my next to last pkg from my first case and they are not at all stale. I stored them in my cool dark garage in their original cardboard box.<br /><br />Also they are made in Belgium if that helps anyone. The packaging is air tight and they come 12 pkgs in a box and are in the perfect sized box, and mine arrived without a sign of any damage and I have yet to find even a single cracked rice cake! They are rather neutral in their taste... I make a special butter spread that I like on them real well. You take equal parts of room temperature butter, olive oil and water and blend ingredients until smooth. You can refrigerate this, it sets up but doesn't get hard so it is always spreadable and tastes really good! I use organic butter, olive oil and filtered water, but you don't have. This spread is so good and I believe it's better for you than straight butter.<br /><br />Also, I only use one cake to make a single sided sandwich, as with any rice cake using two as you would two pieces of bread just doesn't seem to work as well. But a single sided sandwhich with these rice cakes is very enjoyable!<br /><br />Hope this helps you decide to try them. Everyone I've given some to, have had only good comments about them.",Best gluten-free substitute for bread ! ! ! And worth every penny!
"summarize: By the title, you should get the hint of what this product is all about. First af all, I have fed this Duck and Potato dry food to my dog for 4 years and never had a single issue, in fact she was a heathly vibrant dog with great vitality during that period. I bought 4 large bags about 5 months ago, because I like to keep a nice supply on hand. After I fed her from a freshly opened bag, I was greeted with a bloody diarrhea crime scene all over the house at 3:00 in the morning. Actually, it was more blood than stool and I freaked out not knowing what was going on, she was then shaking uncontrollably in discomfort. I took her to the vet and $200 later after all the tests, we found nothing. I put her on a strict chicken and rice formula for a month and she was just fine, so I decided to start feeding her the same Natural Balance again, not knowing it was the food doing it and the same nightmare happened again(bloody mucusy stool). Another month of Chicken and rice and no problems. Well, tonight I mixed in literally 15 small pieces of that Duck and Potato with a bunch of rice and chicken and I can already hear her stomach gurgling like it did before. I promply gave her an anti-diarrheal just to be safe, but i'm watching her close and it'll probably be another sleepless night of cleaning up a disaster zone.<br /><br />I just finished reading other reviews tonight on the net about other people having similar problems and it's all because this company changed their formula. I think the ""new"" formula is worse than that tainted malamine food that got in the supply a few years ago. My pet store won't return the bags I have, because I never thought about keeping the receipts from a product I've used for soo many years without problems, now I have to eat another $200 and toss this junk on the garbage. I won't even consider giving it to my neighbors dog, because I'm not the sadistic type.<br /><br />This product should be recalled and it's not healthy for any dog. Even if it seems the dog might not be showing bad symptoms, it can't possibly be good considering what my dog has gone through. Shame on you Mr Patten for cutting corners and you better come out with a formal apology for this mishap. I am using several types of your canned food at the moment(except the duck and potato canned food) and the are no problems this those(yet), but rest assured I've lost faith with the reputation of your company and will move on to other healthier avenues for my dogs dietary needs.",This Poison Should Get 0 Stars
"summarize: Because I'm always looking for ways to get my son to eat more protein, I thought I'd give the Planters Big Nutty Bars a try.  I'm not a fan of granola OR peanuts but I thought these were actually pretty tasty!  They're not dry like some granola bars are (this doesn't mean they won't make you thirsty).  They reminded me more of a candy bar, maybe because of the layer of peanut butter on the bottom.  I kept the wrapper on while eating it (rolling it down as needed), avoiding any sticky hands or mess.  I'd recommend this as a filling snack that's easy to keep in your purse or backpack.  It didn't earn 5 stars because though it's made of whole grain oats, it also has a bunch of  oils and fructose (which is probably why it actually tastes good).",Pretty tasty even if you're not a granola fan
"summarize: I have been a huge fan of this, the ONLY authentic malted mix, in my estimation, since childhood 6 decades ago.<br /><br />I can understand that not every grocery store might want to carry it, but I am absolutely baffled that it is such a rarity on ANY grocery stores' shelves!<br /><br />I guess when Nestle bought Carnation, it became just another product and no one is really attempting to market it. More's the pity.<br /><br />I have found it on the shelves of a WalMart superstore in Kingston, NY, as well as the Kingston Shoprite down the street from the Walmart. Kingston is the largest population center for a radius of about 15 miles, and boasts a meager population of about 23,500. 2 stores within a half-mile of each other carry it where population is so sparse.<br /><br />I live in Westchester county, in the suburbs of NYC (pop. 8,000,000) and can't find it anywhere! Not at the A&P, Super Stop and Shop, NOWHERE! I have to drive to Harlem, 20 mi. away, in NYC to find it.<br /><br />My opinion is that it's a failure of Nestle's salespeople. SOMEONE within a 5-mile radius of Mamaroneck, NY (pop. 18,350, in a densely populated area) should carry it!",Why is this stuff so hard to find?!!
"summarize: I have always liked Bran flakes, so I was a little hesitant to try this ""new"" version of Rasin Bran. I turned out to be pleasantly surprised to find that adding the cinnamon and almond made this cereal taste great. There was just the right amount of flavoring to make the cereal taste different. Adding the almond seemed to also make the texture of the cereal less grainy, which is a good thing if you don't normally go for the texture of bran cereal.  I wish the box was bigger, because I really enjoyed eating this. I would definitely purchase this again as it is a great healthy cereal that tastes good as well.",Cinnamon almond flavor makes old bran favorite new.

"summarize: I have tried lots of brands and they were decent for iced tea.  Then,  a family from New Orleans moved here to Washington State.  In the South, sweet tea is like our coffee in Seattle.....a serious matter.<br />I make my sweet tea in a two gallon pan, put in one gallon of water and wait until is is boiling.<br />add your tea bags, let it go for about 5-10 minutes.  Then, while the pot is still on the stove, remove the tea bags.  into the pot, add your sugar (I use 50% brown sugar, 50% white sugar).  Let the boiling tea dissolve the sugar (it doesn't dissolve well if you wait for the tea cool down).  Stir it until the sugar is dissolved.<br />Add a gallon of cold water and stir, pour into pitchers a place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />This tea is rich and musky.  It is not bright a springy.

"summarize: I really like full-bodied coffee -- I learned to love european years ago and no long enjoy the weaker/lighter American style roasts. Now I have to cut down on my caffeine, and I have a much more limited choice than before.<br /><br />After reading the reviews on Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf, I was excited to find out how good it would be for my new Keurig. I find it marginally more tasty than Timothy's similar style decaf (which is slightly bitter), but it also has a bitterness that I just do not enjoy. Strong and/or full-bodied coffee does not have to be bitter. I bought the Keurig filter so I could brew my own choice of coffee (without K-Cups). No K-Cup I have tried so far compares with Peet's decaf using the filter -- but the filter is just not convenient, and convenience is the reason why I bought the Keurig.<br /><br />I have finally settled on Green Mountain Donut Shop Decaf for my K-Cup of choice. It may not be quite as full-bodied as the Emeril's (it's actually pretty close), but it definitely does not have the bitterness.",Full bodied but a little bitter
"summarize: Since I developed a wheat allergy I've tried every gluten-free pasta out there. Most are gross- they either have a strange taste of corn or beans or they get mushy or have some other weird texture. The leftovers have a tendency to turn to a weird sort of paste. Yuck!<br /><br />This stuff, however, is fantastic! You must follow the directions correctly but if you do it has a great texture that is close to regular pasta. While the flavor is obviously slightly different than regular pasta I've served it to people with a properly seasoned sauce who said it was better than regular pasta. It holds up, covered in sauce, as well for leftovers as regular pasta.<br /><br />I especially love the spaghetti with a homemade marinara sauce and the lasagna noodles made in the best lasagna recipe EVER [...] though I alter the recipe a bit by making extra sauce, baking a little longer, and don't bother pre-cooking the noodles.<br /><br />I'm LOVING that I can buy in bulk from Amazon, at a much cheaper price than my local health food store.",The only gluten-free pasta worth eating

"summarize: Ok. First I just have to say that Meaty Bones should be a dog owner's staple, my dog LOVES them... but the problem is with these companies who are selling their products! I mean really? This was originally priced at $80???! For ONE bag???? Then marked down to 10 or 11 something. Jee, they aren't trying to trick people into thinking they are getting some awesome deal and make profits at the same time. Then the buyer gets the product only to find out it is one 6lb bag they could have bought driving pretty much anywhere that sells dog food and buy it for the already 'discounted' price! That is what is costs, not $80!!!! I am so fed up with these companies inflating the cost of their products and then 'deeply discounting' them to boost sales and make the consumer think they are getting the best deal ever. I mean I realize they have done that for years and years but I feel like over the 2 years it has gotten way out of control. And don't even get me started the the free shipping BS (not amazon prime but other companies) where if you return the product they deduct the original shipping from your refund. Shipping was never free, you paid for it in the inflated price of the deeply disocunted product!!! uhg this should be against the law!!!!!",I hope no one is buying this crap!
"summarize: Yesterday, I had posted a rating of 2-stars for this product because one of my cats got violently ill after eating it.  Afterward when I tried to give him a little, he wouldn't even go near it.  I was worried about my cat, so he was my main concern.<br /><br />It turns out that my previous suspicion was right:  he got sick because of a hairball, not the food.  I feel so relieved that he's okay.  I'll just have to make sure to brush him more so this doesn't happen again.  So, I've upgraded ny review to a 5-star rating.<br /><br />Now, he loves it!  When I fed my cats this morning, my cat who got sick gobbled it down with gusto, like he normally does!  That was such a relief!  There weren't any pieces left in the dish.  I mix it with Friskies to give them a little variety, which they seem to like, so it's easy to see when they don't like something.<br /><br />As a side, both of my cats also love the Halo wet food - it's their favorite thing to eat.  They go crazy when I give it to them for dinner!  I am still waiting for the Lamb Spot Stew to show up - it's a new flavor for them and I'm sure they'll just love it.",They love it - both of them!!!
"summarize: I was excited to try these and when they arrived in the mail I opened the package, closed my eyes and got a whiff of an almost medicinal smell.  The weather is quite hot now, and the package was warm when I opened it so that might have contributed to the smell. The texture was quite nice, chewy, not hard. The taste, however, did not appeal to me and the licorice did have an aftertaste that I did not care for.<br /><br /> I liked the packaging, the size of the licorice, and the amount contained within the package - I just did not care for the Pomegranate flavor and would like to try some of the other ones available.<br /><br />I also wish it was made in the USA instead of Mexico, but I have to think that because of the reputation of Newman's Own products that it is being made under the strictest of regulations.

"summarize: This product is salt with some other stuff mixed in with it. The label is not real specific about what is in it other than ""salt, red pepper and other spices, garlic and silicon dioxide"".<br /><br />I use it strictly as a salt substitute. It has a little more flavor than just salt but to me it is not really Cajun seasoning as it has no real heat to it and is quite salty. It is just too salty to use enough of it to taste any heat, or to use it as a rub.<br /><br />I have gotten a canister of it as gift now and then because people know I like hot sauce.

"summarize: I have taken Braggs ACV for eight straight months. That's right, I've religiously taken 1-2 tablespoons 2-3 times per day for 250 days. I'd like to share my personal experiences and the changes my body has gone through since I started last October.<br /><br />At the outset of my ACV ""diet"" I was a pretty healthy 6'2"" 210 pound 29 year-old guy with a decent spare tire around my waist. I was enjoying life a little too much and exercising too little. I started taking ACV for heartburn. I enjoy cooking so I had a bottle of it in my kitchen already. After experiencing the instant and amazing relief (and energy boost), I did a bit of research and found out that it cures a laundry list of other ailments. It sounded too good to be true, so my skeptical self decided to give it the old college try for a month. I continued taking it and noticed within days that I was sleeping better, eating better and generally had more energy. After a few weeks, my wife noticed that I had lost weight, and I shocked myself one day when I caught myself in a full-length mirror. I was getting my skinny college body back! And this without any exercise or apparent change in diet. I was doing nothing different except for the addition of ACV to my diet.<br /><br />Energy levels. This is the first thing you'll notice as the ACV hits your stomach. Almost instantly, you get a natural boost that lasts for hours. Any desire to eat unhealthy food fades. I've read that this is a result of the normalizing effect it has on blood sugar. This is also related to the weight loss people experience while taking it. The high energy levels given by ACV is my new normal.<br /><br />Addiction. Before taking ACV, I was drinking far too much alcohol and caffeine. A pot of coffee was my mainstay during the day and a bottle of wine was easy to finish after dinner. A few years ago I was getting heart palpitations from drinking too much caffeine so I quit cold turkey, but my usage was creeping back up again. Fast forward to after eight months on Braggs--I drink one glass of coffee per day (maybe two) and am lucky if I can finish a bottle of wine or a few heavy beers. My stomach just says ENOUGH. Oh, and no heart palpitations since!<br /><br />Sleep. I was a sleepwalker as a child. I never grew out of it. As an adult, I still sleepwalk and in addition suffer from insomnia and sleep paralysis (where you wake up, can't move and believe something is in the room with you--not fun). Before ACV I'd get sleep paralysis a few times per week and sleepwalk a few times per month. I needed 9-10 hours of sleep per night to feel rested. After ACV I fall asleep easier, RARELY get sleep paralysis and don't sleepwalk anymore. I wake up feeling refreshed after 7-8 hours.<br /><br />Weight loss. While not a magical fat-burning elixir, it will control your blood sugar and cravings, resulting in a slow weight loss over time. My ""spare tire"" is nearly gone and some of my pants are looking big on me. I'm continuing to lose weight slowly, and family and friends who only see me a few times per year always remark how thin I'm getting. ACV also gets rid of water bloat, which will have the visual effect of weight loss right away. Take it before going out to Macaroni Grill to prevent feeling like a lumbering dinosaur afterwards. Now that the weather is warmer I've started jogging and this magnifies the weight loss even more, and a shot beforehand always ensures a great workout with high energy levels.<br /><br />Skin. I never had a problem with acne before so I can't comment on its use for that. I did break out with some psoriasis on my nose recently, and I thought it was just dry skin. But it didn't go away after a month and was getting worse. I applied ACV directly with a Q-tip for a couple weeks and PRESTO it was gone. Amazing!<br /><br />Digestion. If you suffer from heart burn or acid reflux (I had both!) ACV works wonders. It also calms the stomach after a large meal and eliminates bloating and hangovers. It acts as a ""cleanser"" of sorts, so don't stray too far from the bathroom the first few times you take it. You'll be amazed at what comes out. On second thought, no you won't. Just flush.<br /><br />Immune system. I had a pretty strong one before starting the Braggs diet, however I still found myself getting sick a couple times per year, whether it was something nasty like the flu, a sinus infection or simply a cold brought on by stress. Guess what? I haven't been sick in eight months. Not even a sniffle. If I ever get sick again, I will be surprised.<br /><br />Here are a couple pointers. If you can't stand the taste, mix it with honey or juice. Or just man up and shoot it like a tequila shot (after awhile you'll get used to it). Now I simply drink it straight and instantly chase it with a big glass of water. I shoot it back so it doesn't touch my teeth and swish my mouth with the water. If you do it right it doesn't burn. Just think of it as really tart apple cider. If you're going to wuss out of taking ACV because of the taste, you're doing yourself a disservice and missing out on a lot of health benefits.<br /><br />Apple cider vinegar does AMAZING things to every bodily system. I don't know how it works, but it works. I was a believer after days and will remain one for years. Now I know why doctors and the medical establishment scoff at ACV--if everyone took it they'd be out of a job! Do your body a favor and start your own Braggs experiment!",An eight month experiment that changed my life
"summarize: I enjoyed Lindt Excellence 70% as a lunch treat for over ten years. It was a real favorite of mine, and I trusted a company like Lindt to not mess with a 165-year tradition. I was wrong. Lindt seems to be pursuing Hershey (or worse) now, instead of keeping a proud tradition alive. (The recipe has, by the way, only changed for the US market.)<br /><br />Lindt is still calling this Excellence 70% Cocoa (although the tag at the bottom does say ""Smooth Dark"" instead of ""Intense Dark""). But it is a (literally) pale reflection of the original recipe, and an insult to the Lindt tradition. At least when Coca Cola screwed up, it had changed the name to New Coke so it could easily bring back Classic Coke. Lindt is now stuck, by drastically changing the recipe but not changing the name. Those who liked the old recipe have abandoned them with this change, and are not likely to trust them again, and those who like the new recipe will react the same if they change it back. I think this one will be studied in biz schools as a ""how not to do it"" case.",The new recipe is bland plastic-y junk chocolate
"summarize: So, 7 years ago when I made the biggest ""happy"" mistake of my life (getting the first dog) I asked a Vet what the best food I could purchase for my new puppy would be. She answered Royal Canin. I have no idea if this is true, nor do I even have the energy to look it up. I took her at her word and that is that. When the second biggest ""happy"" mistake joined the first, this is what we fed her. Both the dogs seem to really enjoy eating as dogs usually do. Though just because they eat the food does not mean it is any good...these are creatures who take great pride in eating each others poop.<br /><br />Both dogs are very healthy, have nice coats and teeth and wonderfully cold, wet noses.

While the customers still liked it ok, I found it almost unpleasant with chemical overtones rather than the soft rich vanilla I expected.  And the texture was tough and gummy and it soaked up the humidity like a sponge.  I had to keep clearing the buildup on the inside of the bowl and the cleanup afterwards was like getting melted gummy bears off.  I've never had this much of a problem with Gold Medal or even plain white sugar even on the muggiest days and today was a pleasant summer day with modest humidity.<br /><br />Bottom line, cannot recommend and will never use again.

"summarize: Long popular in Asia in food for its health-promoting properties and long popular in the US in lotions for its healing properties, aloe vera extracts, or this case pulp, are cropping up in different foods and drinks.  Chantea has produced a nicely flavored, sweetened green tea.  Because this is a Taiwanese company, it makes sense that they are trying to bring aloe vera to the American market.  The passion fruit flavor is quite good.  Suspended in the  tea is aloe vera leaf pulp.  It is reminiscent of orange pulp, and since this is passion fruit flavored, you get the sense of passion fruit pulp.  Aloe vera does not have much of a flavor on its own.  Aloe vera pulp can be on the slimy side (think what would happen of an orange and okra mated), but in this drink it is not at all slimy.<br /> If you want a drink that is clear, you will be in for a shock.<br />If you want a fruit-flavored tea drink that has substance, this is for you.",Not Your Normal Flavored Green Tea

"summarize: This coffee is too mild, had to set it down to 6 oz size on Keurig, when i do this, get sometype of bitter aftertaste.<br />Have used about ten cups now, notice leaking at the top of my Keurig where the needle puntures it.  I have been puncturing the top of the kcup with a thumbtack before brewing as not to have an issue with the packaging. A couple of the kcups seem to get somewhat smashed in the brewer and I have never had that problem with other kcups before.  Don't think I would order these again.<br />They seem to have too many issues with the packaging and I should have waited until this was resolved. I'm going back to using my kcup.",Too mild and there is an issue with these cups
summarize: This is one of my favorite gluten-free meals. The noodles are good and the texture is just right. The spices and flavor are great. I use canned chicken instead of tuna for a different taste. I also use more water and milk (I use soy milk)than called for to get a jucier dish. You can experiment by gradually adding more each time you make it until you get it just right. I also double the amount of canned chicken or tuna. I buy it by the case to make sure I always have it on hand. Super product! And super service from Amazon!,Mrs. Leeper's Creamy Tuna Dinner (gluten-free)
"summarize: I bought this vinegar because it had the mother, and I wanted to use that as a starter culture for making my own vinegar from my abundance of wild grapes.  Well, the grapes aren't ripe yet, but I decided to experiment, using it to start a small batch of pineapple vinegar.  I cut the skin off the pineapple, popped it in a big glass jar, covered it with purified water and a couple tablespoons of Bragg's ACV, put the lid on very loosely (must have air to make vinegar) and let it ferment for a week.  I then strained out the pineapple skin and let it ferment for 3 more weeks (stirring it daily).  The new mother formed quickly and perfectly, and I didn't have any mold issues at all.  The pineapple vinegar tastes so good, I am making more!<br /><br />In the meantime, since I had most of a bottle of the ACV left, I decided to try it as a drink, hoping it will help with my allergies.  I just started this a couple days ago, so I can't attest to any results just yet.  But I put 2 teaspoons in a 16 oz bottle of water, and add some stevia to sweeten it up and pop it in the fridge to get cold.  Tastes GREAT!  I tried it without the sweetener and it was too harsh, but with it, it is almost like ACV lemonade -- very delicious and refreshing!  I also just started adding it to my dog's water to see if it helps with his allergies.<br /><br />Even if it doesn't end up helping with my household's allergy problems (but here's to hoping), it's still defintely worth it just as a starter for anyone interested in making their own homemade vinegars.",Great starter for making homemade vinegar
"summarize: As a kid, I loved going to movies and chewing on Twizzlers as soon as the previews started.  It has been a long time since I've had the candy, though, and I haven't been tempted by it for years.  These pomegranate licorice twists, though, are bringing back old cravings by updating them for an adult.  When I first started one of the twists, I was not a fan - I didn't think that the pomegranate flavor blended well with the hit of licorice flavor at the end.  I kept going, though, to put in an honest effort, and I grew to love these strangely addictive little candies.  It's not that the flavors don't blend - it's that they're textured and nuanced, rewarding slow contemplative chewing.  The pomegranate taste is juicy (and trendy, yes), and the spices keep things interesting.  I also like that the package has plenty of short twists, so they're easy to share, and each one isn't too much of a commitment if your friend doesn't enjoy the flavors.","Twizzlers for grown-up foodies, perfect candy for an indie theater"
"summarize: Real Food Toppers are a healthy and nutritious snack.  I can get my cats to do anything for a treat.  When they don't want to eat their food, I crumble some toppers on their food and ""presto"" all of their food is gone.  I have made the mistake of leaving the Toppers in a place that a smart and resourceful pair can get, only to wake up in the morning to a chewed up empty bag of Toppers!  This treat will bring them out of hiding when I can't find them.  All of that and it's pure and nutritious.  Toppers are freeze dried chicken (or beef, salmon). Nothing else.  No added ingredients.  Try them.  You and your pet won't be disappointed!!!!!!",Get your pet to do anything you want for this nutritious treat!
"summarize: Cookies are like a punch line.  Eat them and you get a flavor that should remind you of something.  Think of Oreos, as an example.  Oreos have this great chocolate hit and that scrumptious icing flavor (if you eat the cookie whole) that has been a life-long constant.  Fig Newtons are another example of a cookie that has a powerful flavor that I savor.  These cookies, on the other hand, are just somewhat...well...blah.<br /><br />I was looking forward to tasting these cookies.  After all, Nabisco has named these with the auspicious title ""Fig and Honey.""  I love Fig Newtons and I was thinking about those when I took my first bite.  What I tasted was more like a graham cookie.  Okay, any second now I will taste fig and honey.  I kept crunching and savoring and all I ever got was graham.  I tried another cookie to see whether the effect was the same.  Sadly, the result remained the same.<br /><br />I could get into all the details about palm oil, preservatives and calories, but I am just unable to be enthused for a cookie that fails to excite me.  If you are a fan of Fig Newtons, then these pale in comparison.  In fact, if you like a cookie with a taste that hits your taste buds, then move along to something else.  After all, there are many cookie brands at the supermarket superior to these.  These cookies will not be on our future grocery lists.",Bland Entry in a Crowded Market
"summarize: I had originally bought this pack of 6 hoping to replace the recessed lighting in my new kitchen. Read prior reviews saying that 23 watt would not be bright enough, even though this is generating an equivalent of 100 watts. I have four recessed spots in kitchen, and after installing, figured they were way too bright. When I say TOO bright, they were eye-piercing bright. So I instead got the 15 watt ones instead, and they were more than enough. Unless, you are showcasing something inside or are using it outside on the patio, the 13 watt or 15 watt CFLS should be more than enough.","Great bulbs, but too bright for me"
"summarize: I ordered this item for my wife for christmas, she had been wanting some chocolate covered beans for a few months. We had seen some at different places but the price was usually over $1.00 an ounce. So when I found these on Amazon for $38 for 5 pounds I decided to give them a try. We were both very pleasantly surprised by not just the quality of the item, especially since it was in 5 lb bulk bag but also the flavor of the dark chocolate and the Kona bean together. It was a perfect combination. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone, and I plan to buy more very soon as we are down to our last pound.",Excellent item for a great price
"summarize: I have a Bichon Frise with a horrible stomach for keeping any food down. This was the only dog food we could find that she wouldn't throw up. It was recommended by our vet who said our Bichon just had a lot of allergies and this food was known to work well with dogs having her problems.<br /><br />It's a bunch cheaper on amazon than any local pet store we could find, and we don't have to have the trouble of lugging the 30 lb bag home.<br /><br />However, the reason for the loss of 1 star -- our dog really dislikes the taste of it. She's on a pretty tight diet to lose weight currently and still refuses to eat the food immediately when poured into her bowl. She'll sniff it on and off for about an hour before eating it. It also gives her pretty bad breath, but these are both things I can live with to eliminate the stained carpets.<br /><br />We have been using the food for over 2 years with no problems; I definitely recommend it if your dog has a sensitive stomach.",Only thing that will settle in my Bichon's stomach
"summarize: I have a very picky rottweiler mix who is not very food motivated and does not like a lot of ""hard"" chews that would last her a whiile. (Even the chews she loves she usually gives up on after 20 minutes or so, so there's no such thing as giving her something that lasts hours, unfortunately) I originally purchased these at the store one day as I had long ago realized that the only way to find out if she likes something was to try it. I actually didn't think she'd like them, and intially I don't remember her liking them as much as she does now. I would simply rotate them into the schedule (I usually leave her with one ""chew"" when I leave the house even though she never touches it when I get back)<br /><br />I'm not sure when she started really going nuts for them, but suddenly she absolutely can't get enough of them! I'm giving her almost one a day now and she's still going crazy for them. She has a thing with ""licking"" (licking the carpet, the couch, etc) if she's bored and giving her these completely distracts her from doing it. Perhaps that's why she likes them so much - she likes to lick them before she actually eats them.<br /><br />It actually reminds me of how my now-deceased (and food crazy!) boxer mix would treat regular rawhides - she would lick and chew them until they were soft and chewy and then ALL the dogs would try to get their paws on it! My dog loves to chew it down until it gets mouth sized and then she will chomp on it until she swallows it.<br /><br />Of course not all treats are for all dogs - but these work well for my dog and are pretty cheap. They probably wouldn't work well for very aggressive chewers but for a soft-mouthed dog like my own they aren't very messy and can still keep her occupied for about half an hour or so. (which is the most I can get from anything whatsoever) She does have a tendency to leave little stubs of it lying around when she can't finish it, but sometimes if I pick them up and give them to her when I run out she'll be satisfied with it. Also, and this is gross to admit, but I kind of like the way it makes her breath smell after she's been chewing on it. (It doesn't have a strong smell that I can sense until she's actually chewing on it.)<br /><br />I can actually (for once) actually find them cheaper at the store than on Amazon.",My Dog Can't Get Enough for Whatever Reason.... Almost like Rawhides!
"summarize: Our dog is on a lifelong limited ingredient diet due to inflammatory bowel disease.  He eats the venison & potato dry food and gets a low maintenance dose of prednisone.  The IVD (now Royal Canin) food worked well, but we've were outraged by the constant price hikes and annoyed by the inconvenience of only be able to buy the food at a vet.  Then we discovered Natural Balance.  On a price per pound basis it's about half the price. Our dog has done very well with this food.  Although there is no way for me to be sure, I also think it's likely that sweet potato is more nutritious than plain potato, so that's another benefit.  If you buy from Amazon there is free shipping and no sales tax, as well.<br />The food is a little more dense, so if you're switching from Royal Canin you might want to weigh your regular feeding of the old food, and determine how much of a scoop of the new food gives the same weight.  Not a big difference, but if you want to feed the exact same amount then go by weight.<br />Very pleased with this food.  It's still expensive, but not like the thuggish price gouging from Royal Canin.",Excellent alternative to overpriced Royal Canin (IVD) product
"summarize: We're comfortable being honest are we not?  Cool, so I have a coffee problem, I'm OK admitting that to you.  And with that affliction comes the experience of having consumed a crap-load of coffee from all over, K-cups and otherwise.  In the end, Highlander-esque, there can be only one, and the Double Black Diamond is that coffee.  This is the untouchable, best Keurig coffee that I have ever encountered and I am relatively sure that once or twice while drinking it I experienced the mythical Quickening.<br /><br />Buy it, don't buy it, I don't care, just get out of my way so I can keep drinking it.  I just want to die with the taste of it on my lips.",Did you feel that coffee lover?  That was the freaking Quickening!
"summarize: I recently became obsessed with dried cherries. I've tried a few no-sugar brands, and Eden's are by far the best. They're transitional-to-organic, meaning they will be USDA certified organic and they are currently using organic growing practices. They're lightly sweet thanks to organic apple juice, and yet they're lightly tart with a lot of cherry flavor. They're a beautiful red color and somehow despite being dried are still quite plump and almost juicy! They always taste so fresh and are lightly chewy. I tried Bare Fruit and another brand that was in the bulk section of Whole Foods, and both of those were more like raisins and had unpleasant aftertastes. I can sit and eat an entire bag of Eden's dried cherries, it's almost like eating a fresh cherry pie! And the light oil helps make these so they don't stick together which is nice. They're my new favorite snack and dessert, I choose these over even chocolate! They're $6.99 for a 4oz pack in Whole Foods, so I've been getting them on Amazon's subscribe and save for about $4.73 per 4oz pack. I wish they'd do case discounts, I LOVE these cherries!!!",Simply the best (organic) dried cherries!
"summarize: You name it, I've tried it.... clay, corn, wheat, silica, pine, newspaper, cedar, various combinations of the above, and multiple brands of several varieties ... none of them worked as well as the green tea litter.  It's the best odor control I've found.  It doesn't stick to my long-haired cats butts and create a clumpy mess that has to be clipped out of their pantalones (a major issue with long-haired cats and clumping litter).  It eradicates the litter box smell better than anything else I've found.  It doesn't have a strong or chemical smell.  To top it off, the cats prefer it to anything else I've tried and all adapted to it immediately.  It also tracks less than the other options.<br /><br />The only issues I've had are:  1. It's a pain in the neck to order it and then wait for a week for it to show up; 2. Because of the larger chunk size I had to find a scoop with larger holes than average and that was a bit of a pain; and 3. The chunk size is too big to work with the littermaid I own.... the thick plastic tines just acted like a shovel, instead of a scoop -- and it's just too expensive to be throwing clean litter out when it's still good like that.<br /><br />Green tea litter vs. keep using the LitterMaid?....  the green tea litter won and the LitterMaid has been retired.... yeah, the green tea litter is better at lowering litterbox hassle than the self-scooper.<br /><br />If the chunk size was small enough to work well with the littermaid, this would be 5 stars.<br /><br />I did just order an OmegaPaw rolling litterbox to try with it -- hopefully that will work out and make cleaning the box easier -- with 8 cats I need all the help I can get.<br /><br />Update......<br /><br />It's too chunky for the ""roll n clean"" grid.... it WILL go through, but instead of slowly roll it one way, then roll it back, pull out the tray and dump it, then roll back further to put the clean litter back.... it's slowly roll it forward to tilting toward the end..... spend a couple of minutes shaking the heck out of it to get the non-clumped litter through the grid, finish rolling it and then roll it back, dump the drawer and then roll it back the other way and shake the heck out of it again to get the clean litter back in the other direction.....  a workout which pretty much takes the ease of use of the ""roll n clean"" away.  I'm contemplating modifying the roll n clean and then retrying with larger slots to see if that works.  Decided to try a LitterMaid Ultra Mega because of the wire tines in the rake and the larger gaps between and it still raked way too much clean litter -- acting more like a shovel than a rake.  At this point I'm back to testing litter/box combos looking for a solution.... with 8 cats and a bad back, the notion of scooping by hand several times a day is not a good one.","I've tried everything, and this is the best"
"summarize: Tinkyada noodles are absolutely the very best gluten free noodles. Many gluten free noodles are gritty or turn out gummy after cooking. The tinkyada noodles are wonderful - they have the perfect consistency, not sticky, gummy or gritty and I've yet to have anyone realize that they're not ""regular"" noodles.<br /><br />I've tried other rice noodle brands and nothing compares to the quality of these. My only suggestion is that you cook them the way you would normally cook noodles (boil the water w/salt, add noodles, taste test and remove when ala dente). The instructions on the bag are odd and for me they don't turn out quite right.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with these!",THE BEST Gluten free pasta! Tastes like regular wheat pasta!
"summarize: My two mixed breeds *love* pressed rawhide bones; a good thing as pressed rawhide is supposed to be better and safer for them than the regular kind.  The problem is that pressed rawhide is also a lot more expensive than the regular kind, almost $3 each at the local pet store.  These are about $1.66 each (w/free A-Prime shipping), which is about the same as my other online source in lots of 20 + shipping.<br />Good quality (imho better than the pet-store chews), and the dogs like them.  Only minor criticism I have is that it seems the Q50 bulk price should be a little better than the Q20 price.","Still a bit pricey, but convenient and dogs like them"
"summarize: The defective packages have holes or ripped areas in the bottom. This let air in and caused entire contents to solidify. Some of these opened packages had been re-sealed with scotch tape. The outer carton was in good shape, so the defects must have been at the source, rather than at Amazon. I will not permit any of the Cracker Jacks in the carton to be consumed because of the risk of contamination.<br /><br />Also, it appears Frito Lay, the people who produce Cracker Jacks, is using Amazon as a place to dump the products. The expiration date on the packages was November of 2008. Looks to me like Amazon got dumped on and I was left holding the bag.<br /><br />Cracker Jacks is apparently not a returnable item.",One out of nine packages was NOT defective
"summarize: A few times a week at work, I'll drink diet soda in the afternoon as a pick-me-up.  I know soda isn't very healthy for you, so I've also tried a few different flavors of hot tea.  Unfortunately for me, a lot of teas are caffeine free.  And those that do have caffeine are typically of a low dose.<br /><br />Therefore, I was eager to try Yogi Perfect Energy Vanilla Spice tea.  The Oregon-based company advertises the product as a natural energizer, without the jitters.  Each tea bag contains 80 mg of caffeine, which is about the same as an 8 ounce cup of coffee.  One of the first things I noticed is that each tea bag has a large amount of ingredients.  There are 14 different herbs listed, including Organic Cinnamon Bark, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and Stevia leaf.  It also contains natural vanilla flavor, Organic Chai Spice Flavor, and Vanilla Bean.<br /><br />You are instructed to use 8 oz of water and steep the bag for 4-6 minutes (longer than a typical tea bag).  Simply put, this is a great tasting tea.  I especially think it's good for people who are not used to drinking normal tea, since the Stevia leaf adds natural sweet flavor.  You don't need to waste calories by adding in your own sugar.  So in terms of taste, I would give it 5 stars.  In terms of energy boost, I would give it 4 stars.  It did not give me as much of an alertness boost as coffee does, but there was definitely a noticeable pick-me-up.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great product for those that like mildly sweet vanilla flavor, or for those that need more caffeine from their tea bag.  I will definitely be ordering these for my office.",Tastes great and provides a nice energy boost.
"summarize: Our house goes through at LEAST 2 full boxes of these individually wrapped bowls of Oatmeal per week.  My stepsons wolf through 2-4 packs per morning, though they will consume any oatmeal put before them... they fight over the fruit and cream so we tend to stick to boxes of that.<br /><br />Often they mix and match, dumping a packed of bananas and cream in with a packet of strawberries and cream.  I don't mind, two growing little boys can eat as much oatmeal as they want in our house.  You couldn't ask for them to eat a more healthy snack.  The other thing that is nice is that my 7 year old can make his own.  So on Saturday mornings when he's up before the rooster crows, he can come down and make his own oatmeal while he waits for everyone else to get up.<br /><br />For the adults, Oatmeal still tastes great, and requires a lot less work then I remember my mom going through when I was little.  It's excellent for your health and can actually lower your cholesterol.",We should own stock in this company
"summarize: I purchased this bar the other day at a local retailer. I have to admit, it looks prety bad, kind of like a beef jerky stick that went obese. Anyway, I read the ingredients and everything was organic and all that. They had little sugar and only 170 calories, with a higher protein content, so I grabbed a hot pepper bar and the regular tanka bar. I was looking for a higher protein, lower carb, lower calorie snack made with real food and this fit the bill. To my surprise, they tasted very good and even my 15 year old step daughter liked them, no small feat. My only complaint is that the price is a wee bit high. However, after going to the company website and doing some research, it occured to me that the meat is buffalo (duh) and the fruit is cranberry, sounds weird but tasted good. I like to support native americans and eat something real and healthy, so I guess it takes a bit more to actually use food instead of mass produced soy and whey protein powders.",Excellent and Tasty High Protein Real Food Bar
"summarize: So a few months ago, I tried the Mint Oreo Fudge Cremes and they were fabulous. I even sought them out at my local grocery store--where they are on sale this week! Less than you can find them on Amazon, which is nice.<br /><br />The Mint Oreo Fudge Cremes taste a lot like Girl Scout Thin Mints.  In keeping with the Girl Scout theme, these taste a bit like the Tagalongs.. only thinner.  Honestly, I didn't like them as much as the Mint Oreo Fudge Cremes.  The peanut butter is overpowering, and I barely tasted any chocolate.  I think this would work better as a traditional Oreo sandwich cookie (chocolate cookie top and bottom) then covered in fudge.  Instead, one has a very thin wafer (thinner than a typical Oreo top or bottom), with a disc of peanut butter, covered by a chocolate shell.<br /><br />If in a store, I had a choice between ""regular"" Oreos and the Mint Oreo Fudge Cremes, I'd buy the Mint Oreo Fudge Cremes quite often. (Although, you can't go wrong with the classic Oreos.)<br /><br />If in a store, I had a choice between ""regular"" Oreos and the Peanut Butter Oreo Fudge Cremes, I'd always buy the regular Oreos.... or the Mint Oreos.<br /><br />Miss for me on this one.  And I love peanut butter.  If you do like these or the other Fudge Cremes, be sure to check your local store's sale flyer.  They were under $3.00 where I live--which is a great deal.","Continuing with the Girl Scout Cookie Theme, Mint are Better"
"summarize: I really liked this ginger drink, but I'm also a huge fan of ginger. If you don't like real ginger, I would guess that you won't like this drink. It's also pretty spicy for a ginger drink.<br /><br />The drink comes in these cool granules that dissolve completely in water. You could sprinkle a little bit of this on a salad, to give it a nice, gingery taste. This tastes like it's made completely from real ingredients, from real ginger, from real lemons, and from real honey. I'm not sure if it is or not, but I couldn't tell anything artificial about this. There are 72 total packets in this item, 6 boxes with 12 packets per box. They recommend one packet for 1 cup (250 ml) of water, but it's intense enough that you could use one packet for two or three cups.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Has a real ginger taste<br />+Very strong<br />+A lot of stuff in each pouch<br />+Dissolves completely<br /><br />Cons:<br />-May be too strong and spicy for the uninitiated to real ginger","Intense, strong ginger, with a little sweet lemon"

"summarize: So, this stuff's advertised as ""soft & chewy"" and made out to be health food, of a sort.<br /><br />Granted it's probably better than a fig newton, since it's made with whole grain flour (oats, hard red wheat, rye, brown rice, triticale, barley, buckwheat, sesame seeds) and various kinds of grain & such. So, there's probably SOME nutritional value. But, on the other hand, it seems to be packed with sugar (apple puree concentrate, evaporated cane juice invert syrup, Banana puree, brown rice syrup, evaporated cane juice). But not enough to make up for the fact that it's also pretty ""heavy,"" despite fulfilling the ""soft"" & ""chewy"" claim. Being honest, I didn't really taste much banana, either (which seems weird considering they use banana puree).<br /><br />I wanted to like these, but they felt more like eating a heavy protein bar, despit there not being especially much protein. The chocolate chips were nice. But, for some reason the little crunchies seemed kind of out of place.<br /><br />So, yeah, far from terrible. Not as heavy as a lot of protein-type bars out there. But not as ""soft & chewy"" as a fig newton or something similar, though possibly slightly healthier on account of the whole grain flour & such? So, it's a mixed bad. I guess I'd say there wasn't anything that dazzled me or set it apart from other such bars.","Okay, but nothing to write home about... A little heavy."
"summarize: My wife and I purchased Timothy's World Coffee, Parisian Nights, Extra Bold K-Cups for over two years and used Amazon's subscription to automatic shipping for the best economy.  It was disappointing to learn a few weeks ago that this particular coffee would no longer be available on the subscription program.  We looked over the list of coffees that would be available and selected Coffee People Jet Fuel K-Cups because the label and description included ""Dark Extra Bold.""  We are very satisfied with the new coffee.  It has the strong, rich flavor and aroma we like.  It is difficult to distinguish this Jet Fuel coffee from our old favorite Parisian Nights.  All of the subscription coffees are in boxes of 50 K-Cups which is a little more economical than the former 24 K-Cup boxes.  This savings plus the discount for subscribing to automatic free shipping results in the lowest cost we have found for these K-Cups.",K-Cup Switch to Coffee People Jet Fuel Proves OK
"summarize: I was pleasantly surprised by this little meal in a box.  It reminds me of the snack boxes the airlines are selling in place of complimentary frozen entrees these days.  Every items comes individually wrapped with a little fork, but surprisingly no napkins for messy eaters.  However, the airlines would charge $8 or more for this selection.<br /><br />The chili lime salmon spread was surprisingly good.  The appearance is initially off-putting (it looks just like the picture on the box) and there is a fishy odor, which your airplane seat mates might not appreciate.  (Though last time I flew United they were offering a tuna box which was also stinky).  The chili does give the salmon a little kick.  The crackers were good, though I wish they had provided 8 instead of 6 as 5 as not sufficient for the size of the salmon spread serving.<br /><br />The dried roasted edamame was so-so.  Edible, but it won't replace Cheetos as my favorite crunchy snack.<br /><br />The ginger fruit and nut mix was very gingery.  It has bananas in it and I accidently ate one - I don't like bananas.  Other than the bananas the seasoning was good - I nice blend of sweet and salty, with emphasis on the sweet.<br /><br />Also included is a chocolate square.

"summarize: A few weeks ago I bought two boxes of packaged chestnut product from Costco (don't remember the brand). That was the first time I bought pre-packaged chestnut. It was peeled, perfectly cooked, and delicious!! Unfortunately they were no longer in stock when I went back and tried to purchased it again. So I went online and found this product on amazon.<br /><br />I signed up for subscribe-and-save, and I figured I would have a long term relationship with this product. Shipping was prompt and the package arrived in good condition. I tore open a bag and was eager to give myself a treat. Then I saw them, the dark (nearly black), soggy, soft chestnuts half-naked hidden inside the mushy shells. I was thinking to myself, hmm, this doesn't look like something delicious. Reluctantly I peeled one chestnut and put it into my mouth. It was stale, soggy, and a little bit sweet, far from what I had expected. I decided to give it a second chance and put the second one in my mouth. It was even worse. It was rotten and had a terrible bitter taste. I quickly spit it out and realized I made a big mistake.<br /><br />I was going to give this product only one star. But realizing I had a very high expectation which may affect my objectivity, I'm giving it two stars in the spirit of being fair. In any case, I do NOT recommend this product. There're far better products out there, like the one sold in Costco.","High expectations, then it comes eating it..."
"summarize: I thought this was pretty decent. I found the scent pleasing without being over-powering and the scent did not linger in an obnoxious way. The body wash lathered nicely and when rinsed off, did not leave my skin as dry, flaky and scratchy as some other products I've used in the past.<br /><br />What is disappointing is that this product contains Petrolatum which is a by-product of petroleum (also known as petroleum jelly.) Petrolatum has been linked to causing or inflaming acne, it can actually clog your pores and of most concern is that it has been recognized as being a possible cancer risk. A bit of Googling will reveal all of this and more.<br /><br />Bottom line for me is that there are plenty of other skin care products that do not contain Petrolatum.

"summarize: If you love this candy, then go ahead and buy this package. If you have no idea what this tastes like, don't bother. I bought a case because the price of the case versus each pack of candy worked out to much less than what I would pay at the store. The product was fresh and tasted even better than the ones that sit in vending machines for weeks.<br /><br />My only complaint/concern is that I ordered for this product in the middle of a heat wave, and consequently the little jelly candies had melted or burst a little in the bag, so they stuck together. Other than that, it just gave me a reason to eat them sooner.<br /><br />This is a good idea to buy if you want some Halloween candy or something to pack with your lunch as a little dessert.",Better than paying $1 per pack at the corner store
"summarize: I really wanted to like this product.  I'm a pretty active person who is always interested in trying out these supplements (even though I know drinking plain old water works as well as anything else), and I love the taste of fruit drinks.<br /><br />This product certainly delivers when it comes to providing a fair amount of vitamins, especially C.  That makes it a good choice, I guess, for those who don't eat fruit but it may be somewhat superfluous if you're already a healthy eater.  There is taurine in this product too, but only 10mg which is a fraction of what you'd find in energy drinks.  It's a good way to get some vitamins, but I have not noticed any kind of energy boost from its use.<br /><br />I had two issues with this product, which I'll cover briefly:<br /><br />1) Taste - I have always liked the taste of fruit punch, and was disappointed with the flavor of this product.  It tasted vaguely of artificial fruit flavoring, but even with a generous amount I never found it very fruity.  It turned my water red, but no amount of the product could make the flavor appealing.  This is just my opinion, and perhaps for others the taste is just fine.  Related to the taste was the lingering aftertaste from the use of sucralose.  This hardly makes it unique among non-sugar drinks, but I thought it worth mentioning.<br /><br />2) Amount to use - The side of the container says, annoyingly, that one squeeze per 8 ounces of water is what should be used.  However, we don't all have the same squeeze so better directions would be useful (eg. two teaspoons).  Or even better, how about something that limits the amount coming out per squeeze?  It may not seem like a huge deal, but I found it frustrating.<br /><br />I doubt I'll use this product much, given that there isn't anything to really separate it from all of the similar products already on the market.  Others may find it useful, though, and I certainly wouldn't pan it as a bad drink additive.","Disappointed, but others may not be"
"summarize: I don't know what it is about the white colored nylabone material; it is just so much softer than the yellowish material. Even though both are labeled ""Dura Chew"" The dogs have not yet taken off sizeable pieces of this bone, but they can leave pretty clear tooth markings. This chew needs closer monitoring than the other nylabones we have bought.<br /><br />*************<br />UPDATE: It is a little more than a year since I first put up this review and I just bought a liver flavored Nylabone that is also made from this white colored material. I'm uploading a customer photo to show the difference. If you have a dog that is an agressive chewer, you may want to stay away from the white nylabone material.","Ok, but a little too soft for our dogs"
"summarize: ****<br />This Kava Stress Relief Tea from Yogi Tea is for anxiety relief. It's an unusual tea, slightly sweet (it contains stevia) and very carob-y. The good news is that it does not have any of the usual kava taste or smell that many people find offensive. The bad news is that I can't feel any of the anxiety relief effects of the tea, although it does say that there are 78mg of kava root extract in the tea. Still, it's a lovely cup of tea, and relaxing because it just tastes good. I can also taste the spiciness of the tea, which is very pleasant. I usually brew two bags in one cup, which is recommended on the package for a stronger and more relaxing effect; however, I even tried four bags once, but still didn't notice a relaxing effect. I am familiar with kava and the overall effect of kava is pretty subtle anyway, so this is something to be aware of. Your experience of the tea may be different.<br /><br />Kava Stress Relief Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh) and has many organic ingredients.<br /><br />The ingredients in Kava Stress Relief Tea are: kava root extract, carob pod, Indian sarsaparilla root, organic cinnamon bark, organic ginger root, organic cardamom seed, stevia leaf, barley malt, natural hazelnut flavor, natural cinnamon flavor, and natural licorice flavor. Amazingly, I can taste many of these in this lovely and complex cup of tea. I would rate the taste five stars for flavor and uniqueness.<br /><br />Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make. Their tea bag tags have metaphysical sayings on them like, ""Your breath is the voice of your soul"" and ""Your head must bow to your heart"".<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Kava Stress Relief tea helps you calm down as it relieves stress, anxiety and minor pain, as well as lending gentle support to the digestion and the kidneys. A member of the peppercorn family, Kava (Piper methysticum) is a highly prized medicinal and beverage plant, whose primary benefit is alleviating anxiety. ""Kava-kava,"" native to Oceania and the South Pacific Islands, has been used and cultivated for its ability to calm the body and mind, and encourage a good night's sleep. A powerful antispasmodic, this herb promotes a state of ""relaxed unconcern"" while compromising neither mental functions nor clarity of thought when used appropriately. Furthermore, Kava has been shown to relax the uterus and relieve menstrual cramps and minor menopausal symptoms.* The Herb Research Foundation (2000) indicates that scientific data supports the use of kava for minor anxiety, stress, restlessness, muscle tension and mild pain. For added flavor, our formula has been complemented with Stevia, Sarsaparilla and Organic Carob. Enjoy a warm soothing cup of Kava Stress Relief, a delicious way to relax.""<br /><br />In addition to the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, there is a warning on the box, ""Ask a healthcare professional before use if you have or have had liver problems, frequently use alcoholic beverages, or are taking any medication. Stop use and see a doctor if you develop symptoms that may signal liver problems (e.g., unexplained fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, fever, vomiting, dark urine, pale stools, yellow eyes or skin). Not for use by persons under 18 years of age, or by pregnant or breastfeeding women. Not for use with alcoholic beverages. Excessive use, or use with products that cause drowsiness, may impair your ability to operate a vehicle or heavy equipment.""<br /><br />Note that the media scare about kava several years ago was not for the kava root, and it is my opinion that based on my own research that kava is very safe. However, I am not a physician, and if you have any health concerns, you should check with an appropriate professional.<br /><br />I decided to give Kava Stress Relief Tea four stars since it didn't really work for me. Still, it is a wonderful and recommended tea, and may work for you!<br /><br />UPDATE: R. and Benjamin say in the comments that it is important to use hot but not boiling water as the boiling water may kill the part of the kava that helps one be relaxed. Please see my comment section for more information. Thanks to R. and Benjamin for their comments.<br />****","Delicious, Yes, May Help With Stress Relief"
"summarize: I chose these tomatoes because they are labeled ""organic.""  Since then I've discovered Muir Glen's cans contain BPA (in the lining).<br /><br />Because research shows solid levels of this chemical leeching from cans and plastics into containers' contents, showing up in Americans' blood streams, from infants to the elderly, I don't think this product can ethically be called organic!<br /><br />Most people empty cans of foods, such as tomatoes, directly into their recipes without thinking of washing them first. (How does one rinse or wash broth or soup, by the way?) In fact, many people like the salt and other seasonings in canned foods, and therefore, never consider rinsing them away. They believe it is safe to use the foods just as they are in the can, which is a reasonable assumption since that is how such products are marketed. Many, if not most, Americans do not yet realize that there is a problem and they are unwittingly feeding that problem to their families.<br /><br />There is something especially unethical and tragic about people paying a company higher prices for organic foods, thinking they are better protecting their health, only to be swallowing BPA with each mouthful, with many feeding it, an endocrine disruptor, to their children.<br /><br />BPA leeching into food is no better or safer than food grown with pesticides. Therefore, until Muir Glen stops using BPA lined cans or stops claiming the organic label and charging organic prices, I can't give high marks for either context.","Dishonest labeling of ""organic"" when cans contain BPA"
"summarize: Archway Classic Soft Oatmeal Raisin Cookies taste like the delicious oatmeal raisin cookies my mother made when I was a little girl growing up in the 1950s and `60s. But Archway Classic Soft Oatmeal Raisin Cookies had something my mother's cookies did not--a hint of spices and nuttiness, and zero trans fat. As a kid, I didn't know or care anything about trans fat. But my father and I, afraid we would never get my mother's homemade cookies again, didn't dare tell her we could taste the difference the Archway secret seasonings made.<br /><br />My mother learned her recipe from her mother, my grandmother, who had learned the recipe from her mother, my great-grandmother, which my great-grandmother retrieved from the back of a 1920s oatmeal cereal box, altered over many years to satisfy their own tastes.<br /><br />When my mother began working and had no time left for baking cookies, she bought different brands of oatmeal raisin cookies for my father and me to try until we agreed that the taste, consistency and appearance of Archway Classic Soft Oatmeal Raisin Cookies came closest to her homemade oatmeal raisin cookies. Archway Classic Soft Oatmeal Raisin Cookies have a delicate golden color, traditional rich spicy aroma, old-fashioned wholesome flavor, gentle sweetness of natural brown sugar, and freshness with that just-out-of-the-oven moist tender texture.<br /><br />My mother served her oatmeal raisin cookies and, later, Archway Classic Soft Oatmeal Raisin Cookies, with a cup of hot, honey-sweetened tea in winter or a chilled glass of the same or lemonade in summer.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005XMK6Y"">Archway Oatmeal Raisin Cookies, 9.25 oz</a>",Archway Classic Soft Oatmeal Raisin Cookies Closest to Mom's Homemade
"summarize: Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein Powder, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)<br /><br />Just received in the mail today: Nutiva(tm) brand Organic Hemp Protein Powder.<br /><br />I have tried many, many kinds of protein powders. I have hated them all, for one reason or another. Most of the time it's because they're pre-sweetened with aspartame or saccharine or even straight-up sugar. I'm not really ""into"" too much sweet stuff. Because I have to consume untenably massive amounts on a regular basis, protein powder will need to be as unobtrusive as possible.<br /><br />I wanted to try Nutiva's hemp powder because it also had a lot of other nutrients in it besides protein, and because all of these nutrients and protein were naturally-occurring, not chemically combined to form some alien mud substance.<br /><br />Right away I noticed the difference. This stuff was powderized, but it's like powderized grass clippings -- olive-green in color, with a smell not unlike alfalfa hay.<br /><br />And this stuff isn't artificial. Besides 11g of protein for every quarter-cup of powder, it also has Omega3 fatty acids in it, and a few other goodies.<br /><br />I love the nutty flavor it lends to food. It changes the appearance of food, however, giving it a khaki-green cast, and it changes the texture of it a bit with a grittiness.<br /><br />It's great in smoothies. Not being a big sweets-consumer, however, I also try to mix the hemp powder into other foods. Mashed potatoes is an interesting choice, particularly if you don't mind consuming green mashed potatoes! It can also be stirred into sauces.<br /><br />I like it WAY better than any other protein powder I've ever tried.","High quality, and a change of pace"
"summarize: This new idea Splenda has come up with seems to be more of a gimic than anything else but I guess adding ""B"" Vitamins or Fiber can't hurt. I did notice a slightly different flavior in my morning coffee but not enough to be turned off by it. Now this new Splenda with added vitamins is packaged in a foil/paper wraper, this keeps it fresher and less likely to become stale or wet. I'll keep using Splenda but not sure if this one is worth spending more than the standard product. I have used the generic Splenda and have to say it's hard to taste the difference.<br /><br />* One other big point, the Packets are hard to open given the new foil liner, I wish they added a pull tab or at the very least score the edges so you have a starting point to help open each packet, who wants to fight with your Splenda before your first cup of coffee?",A new idea to boost sales maybe?
"summarize: I haven't been to australia, but I have heard of this from a youtuber ""itsjudytime"" and she reviewed these which got me to want to try these out because she made them look that good! Luckily i read a comment that they are sold at ""cost plus world market""! I remember passing by one but never really had the curiousity to go check it out until now. Found one near by, and tada...there they were! Wasn't called Tim tams but arnott's was the one i found and to my surprise...3/4 of the boxes were gone, only 3 left so that tells me..it must be delicious! They were about $3.99 at the store and lucky I found them there or else pay for big fee of shipping (but then again, i suppose these would be worth the price for how deelish they are!) so check em out at your nearest world market! I made some hot chocolate and shabam....i was in heaven. I could only eat two in one sitting but if i could..i'd eat the whole thing :) I'll forsure am going to buy some more!",So yummy! Won't be disappointed! :)
"summarize: I too have been searching for Senseo pods for months and finally decided to try another brand. I think the Senseo pods are now coming back in stock btw.  These do fit the senseo and the taste is good. However, out of the 3 packages, 2 had pods that had broken inside and spilled grounds all over the other pods.  This is inconvenient and messy.  I did order another set to see if this was a fluke but lots of other reviewers have experienced the same thing. If I get more broken pods, I will switch back to the Senseos now that they seem to be available in limited selections.",Fits Senseo but pods broken in bag
"summarize: There's only one thing keeping me from giving this a solid 4 star rating: the aftertaste, which I'll get more into later.<br /><br />First, the good. Other than the aftertaste, this tastes pretty good. I can pick out the different flavors of pomegranate, blackberry, honey, and tea, and they don't clash with each other. They're well blended together for the most part and this is pretty awesome with a lot of ice.<br /><br />It's just that the aftertaste ruins it. There's this slight chemical taste to the product that really interferes with the other flavors, making it so I am unable to forget that this is a powdered mix. It isn't something that would keep me from drinking the tea, but with how well everything else works together it's pretty noticeable. Again, this isn't something that I'd say would keep me from going out and purchasing it on my own, just something I hope that Lipton works on in the future.<br /><br />Aside from this, I only had one gripe that did not detract from the product itself and I didn't change the ratings for this at all. I'm just really irritated at the packaging saying that this is a 5 calorie beverage. It is, but only if you plan on using half of the packet. This is something that is standard for most companies and it's really irritating since the majority of consumers will use the entire packet and many will count the entire beverage as 5 calories when it's really 10. It's not as big of a deal here as it is with some of the more sugared products with higher calorie and carb counts, but this is sort of misleading unless you're someone who scours the nutritional and serving information on everything you buy.<br /><br />Overall though, this is something I'd probably go out and buy with my own money.<br /><br />3.4/5","Not bad, has a bit of a weird aftertaste, though"
"summarize: We have a water filter at home and I usually take a bottle of filtered water to work - but when that's gone, there is only tap water, so I keep this at work.  It just takes a squirt per bottle and the strong mineral flavor to our water is tolerable. No artificial sweeteners (which I do use rather than sugars, but try to keep to a minimum), very convenient.  This is a vine product so I didn't pay for it but I will definitely buy more when this is  gone.<br />I've tried several options and the only thing that I like better is a squeeze of fresh lime which is NOT convenient to keep in a drawer at work.",Just takes a few drops to cover the taste of non-filtered water.
summarize: My husband and I love this seasoning. We first tried it at a friends house and we loved the flavoring on the chicken.<br />We then borrowed some and we could not stop talking about it nor stop cooking with it. I came to amazon to see if they carried it and yes they did. My friends didnt visit Kenya often and the price they charge to bring over product or shipping and handling didnt make sense.<br /><br />I first order 5 at a time and then they told me my order could not go through. I didnt think the quantity mattered so then I just put 2 and then my order went through. I know many others are ordering this spice and loves it just as much as we do.<br /><br />Yum Yum YUM. I was looking for the Chicken Flavor but no Luck...,BEST seasoning. We use it almost everyday
"summarize: I'm typically a bar soap kind of guy, Irish Spring or Dial depending on the day. I got some of this to try though and I was pretty stoked. It smelled all manly and stuff; my girlfriend seemed to enjoy the scent as well.<br /><br />Let's just say the enjoyment didn't last long. This junk makes me feel like I have a film on me when I leave the shower. I figure it's all moisturizing or whatever, so that was ignored. What bugs me though, is that I can't make it past 5pm without feeling completely disgusting. My taint gets all tainty and before I know it, my day is ruined and I still have 5 hours to go. I could take another shower, but I'm a busy guy.<br /><br />Here's to switching back to bar soap. I feel clean all day and smell clean, not manly, but at least clean.

Major Fail.","Smells nice, but leaves you dirty"
"summarize: I got this as a gold box deal for a great price. The product tastes great and we've been enjoying it for breakfast. However, it is still comparable to many other competitive products. In other words, nothing to really write home about. I personally do not give 5 stars unless something is absolutely outstanding and beats all my expectations (isn't that what maxing out the star rating should be?). So this gets my 4-star vote, 4.25 if that was available :)<br /><br />BTW, one thing that was surprising was that the cans I received (order Mar 2011) Expire Jan 2012. So either that's a testament of its lack of preservatives and quality or Amazon was getting rid of its expiring products as a gold box deal.","Tastes great, but short of outstanding"

"summarize: Over the past two years, i have been working out 5 days a week. I have tried a ton of different pre-workout supplements. I am little older now and so I wanted something that would make me have enough energy to finish and complete my entire workout.<br /><br />I not only try and change my workouts every 6 months or when I feel like I have hit a plateau in my workout, but I often try different supplements to see if i can see any difference.<br /><br />Labrada Super Charge is freaking awesome. I can take one scoop and within about 15 minutes, I can feel it working. I don't get the weird tingling like you do with Jack 3d and other products, but you can just feel it. I always start my workouts with 5 minute warm-up and I always check my heart rate. This stuff doesn't make your heart go crazy or cause any other strange side affects.<br /><br />On certain days, in my case Leg days, I take about a scoop and half, because I seem to always be weaker and lazier on leg days, because they are my weakest muscle group. But this stuff lets me kick into a higher gear and complete my workout.<br /><br />For the money, it is currently my favorite.

I have to check back with the natural foods department when the supervisor is in to explain that it has to be a mistake.  I'll be ordering them online until the market straightens it out.  But these are amazing macaroons, and my husband keeps eating them up too!  If you like coconut and prefer honey to sugar, you can't go wrong with these delightful treats!

Simply the best cup of coffee I've ever had.  0 acidity and 100% smooth! great notes throughout and makes the perfect cup of night-time coffee.<br /><br />If you much prefer bold/strong coffee, such as myself, then you would not want to buy this coffee. It is not strong at all, but great none-the-less.<br /><br />I highly recommend this coffee for anyone that goes to the area, to at least buy some and bring it back to try.  You will not regret it.","Possibly the best coffee, I've ever had"
"summarize: I had very high hopes. I've seen the Rick Bayless show on PBS and always thought highly of his eagerness of unique and original flavors. Unfortunately the New Mexico skillet sauce was not at all what I expected and it did not live up to the price. Per the directions, I used chicken to create a shredded chicken taco. What resulted was a very thick, pasty red mess that tasted like the generic ""chili seasoning"" spice mix. It was oily, devoid of any complex flavors, and just rather unpleasant. I guess what bothered me most was that an apparently good cook, Bayless, put his name on this. It's a case of the hype not living up to reality.<br /><br />With some kitchen work, I was able to salvage the skillet of chicken, but it required a fair amount of massaging to create something edible. It seemed like the sauce wasn't complete. In the end, the sauce helped to create some good chicken, but it was not at all a one-pack solution as advertised.<br /><br />In the end, if you want a unique and much more flavorful chicken, try the Chi Chis original seasoning. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MBN5TK"">Chi-Chi's Restaurante Seasoning Mix, 0.78-Ounce Packages (Pack of 24)</a>.

"summarize: I thought this Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge product was pretty darn good. I was afraid that it would be too ""chocolaty"" or too sweet, but it's actually a pretty good balance. A few minor complaints is that the dough on the cookie crumbles a bit easily... especially around the edges. I would've liked it more cohesive. Also, the ""fudge"" core wasn't quite creamy enough, as far as the texture is concerned. The fudge also would've been better if it tasted more like ""dark chocolate"", but instead it tastes more like hot cocoa. Despite these observations, I think these are pretty delicious cookies and definitely worth a try.","This is pretty darn good, if you like chocolate"

Filling for lunch or dinner.  Ordered through Amazon prime and literally received in 24 hours!  Signed up for subscription service and paying only 1.50 per cup, a good deal in my book and love that it comes directly to my door.  I would otherwise have to drive 45 minutes to buy in a local grocery store.  So pleased!  Tasty and cheap lunch option.  Will keep several in my desk for work!  Thanks Amazon and thanks Dr. McDougall!","Tastes more like Thai lemon grass soup, delicious!"
"summarize: I'm generally a fan of 5 gum--to the extent that a person can ""have a brand"" of gum, it's my brand. But wow, this stuff is gut-churning. Even by fake-green-apple standards, it's bitter and almost rancid-tasting. Maybe that explains why the flavor only holds up through about eight chews. It's a small mercy, but a mercy nonetheless.<br /><br />If you're a gum dealer looking to score big bucks in the collector's market ten or twenty years down the line, you should probably grab a case or two, because there's no way this stuff will be available much longer. Otherwise, you're better off chewing on your fingernails or old gristle or whatever you can find stuck between the sofa cushions. Or any of 5's other delightful flavors. Except maybe watermelon ... oh, sorry, ""Prism."" I think the person who names these things is the same person who taste-tests them.",A new low in the annals of chewing
"summarize: Once you get over the fact that the Aerogrow is infomercical hype that requires costly ""seed kits"" and special lightbulbs, this is truly an amazing product.  The herbs literally started growing within days.  In less than a month, I have an enormous herb garden.  I don't have to do anything except occasionally add more water, and the Aerogrow even alerts me as to when to do this.  I can't wait to have fresh herbs during winter when they are hard to grow indoors.<br /><br />The ""seed kits"" are seeds in a little sponge that is encased with a plastic housing.  The plastic fits into small holes in the Aerogrow.  The root system pushes out of the sponge and plastic housing and down into the water tank below.  Nutrients are occasionally placed into the water tank.  The Aerogrow has lights to alert when nutrients should be added.  This is not rocket science.  In fact, I removed the provided seeds from one of the sponges and replaced them with cucumber seeds that I'd bought, and literally within 3 days I had a plant that was 3 inches tall.  When you buy seed kits, you are paying for the sponge and plastic housing that fits into the Aerogrow.  Yes, this is a rip off and a crafty person could probably replicate the housing and use another type of sponge to avoid having to buy more costly seed kits.<br /><br />The Aerogrow is costly, as are the component parts.  However, it's true that it will pay for itself.  It is quiet, though it does take up a bit of space.<br /><br />I would give the Aerogrow 5 stars except for the fact that it is costly and the component parts are costly.",Can't Believe They Grow That Fast!!!
"summarize: This is one of the best ways to get nearly complete protein from a vegetable. Use a wide-mouth mason jar (easier to clean) and a stainless mesh drain cover from your local hardware store. This makes daily rinsing easy. Soak overnight the first night. After that, rinse daily and drain well. Cover with the regular jar lid to keep moist. Takes about 3 to 4 days to get a quart of sprouts from one-third cup of dry. These lentils make very tastey sprouts, with a crunch like chopped almonds when cooked with par-cooked potatoes, sweet potatoes or other starchy vegetable. Eight minutes is enough. Don't let them get too long or green before cooking or they will taste a little grassy. Good raw rolled in rice paper with green onions and dipped, or on sandwiches.",Sprouting lentils is easy and nutritious
"summarize: This review is for the coffee, not the roaster (Jersey Shore Coffee Roasters). The roaster is fantastic. I would order from them again. True to their word, the coffee had been roasted 3 days before it arrived; the perfect time to give it a try. It came in a resealable gold foil/mylar exhaust pouch with a flat bottom. It was clearly labeled with the coffee type and roast date. Now on to the product.<br /><br />I've been curious about 100% Blue Mountain estate coffees for years, and after much research, the Mavis Bank Estate came up as one of two that I wanted to try. I ordered the 1/2 pound bag; partially because this bean is so %^#* expensive, and also because I didn't want to get stuck with a pound of beans I might not like, and wish I had the fifty bucks back in my pocket. I much prefer Kona or a Costa Rican peaberry to this. It's a nice coffee; maybe too ""nice"". If you're a connoisseur of mild coffees, this is the one for you. It makes Gevalia Light Roast taste like French roast. Too delicate for my taste. I made a few pots, and kept increasing the amount of coffee. It looked pretty scary whe I was using 6 scoops for five ""cups"", but always tasted bland and watery. I tried it with just a hint of sugar, and nothing else.<br /><br />I'm not into 100% dark roasts at all; I hate that burnt taste. In fact I use a medium roast for my espresso machine. I'll try running some of this through it. Maybe It'll extract some flavor from this curious bean.",Not sure what all the hoopla is about...

"summarize: After doing a bit of research I decided that I should either feed my dog this or Merrick puppy food.  All the other ones I saw either had ingredients that I didn't want to give him or cost considerably more.  Of the two, I think Merrick might be a better dog food, but this one didn't have anything in it that I found objectionable and the difference in price will add up over time so I decided to go with Chicken Soup.  My dog is still a puppy, but I accidentally ordered the adult formula instead of the puppy formula the first time I ordered it.  My dog didn't seem as interested in his food after I switched him from the adult to the puppy formula.  He got over that after a couple days, but I was surprised by that.  I was also surprised to find a can in the middle of the package that was severely dented on the side.  Since it was in the middle of the case that means that it was already dented when it was packaged and not damaged during shipment.  At least the seal wasn't broken, but if it had been dented any further it very well could have been.  Despite that I still think that this is an amazing deal for dog food of this quality.",One of the best affordable wet puppy foods that I have found
"summarize: At first I thought this was more like instant espresso taste made with a something completely new, similar to tea.  When I got it, it is tea.  It's what Chinese call ""red"" tea aka black tea.  There's nothing wrong with it, it's just instead of something completely new, it's the same red tea I've had every since.<br /><br />Now, this does teach me a new way to brew tea.  Never thought of using a coffee or espresso machine on tea, and it actually came out pretty good.  We made a drink using this tea with coffee machine, added heavy dose of creamer and sugar - came out like Thai Tea, which you can find in most Chinese Cafe's.  It's a fairly popular drink, good taste.<br /><br />Then tried this with espresso machine, added condensed milk, this came out tasting like royal milk tea, which is a real bonus.  This drink is really expensive, in restaurants, it's about $3-$4 each, and if you buy instant mix it's about $0.50 each and it mixes about 4oz, so with this tea, it's a good deal.<br /><br />Although the item itself isn't something new, but it does bring new ways to enjoy the food.  Use some creativity and this product is fun and tasty!",A fancy name for Chinese Red ( black) tea.
"summarize: I really enjoy both Living Harvest Original Hempmilk Unsweetened along with Living Harvest Hempmilk Vanilla Unsweetened. Of all the Milks that I have tried (Almond, Coconut, etc.), these are my favorite for just drinking and for baking and cooking with. They are both Low Carb, which is a big plus, (only 1 Carb per cup of milk) (2) Two they both taste good,(It has a refreshing nutty taste, closer in taste to real milk)(3)three they don't have any sugar cane or any other sweeteners mixed in or any odd chemicals or ingredients that would be bad for you, which is a huge plus for me, and (4) Fourth I love the fact that it has Omega 3's packed naturally into the milk. Hemp naturally has its own Omega 3's, so it's not added it's there naturally. AND Omega 3's are really important for the brain. So, since I can't drink Raw Milk, because of Casein sensitivities. . .I now choose Living Harvest Original and Vanilla unsweetened to drink and cook with. I hope they will continue to make these two milks.",Great Tasting Omega 3 Non-Dairy Milk Product!
summarize: I've tried about 30 varieties and this is one of my everyday cups. This actually tastes like Folgers which I also like but this is cheaper. I think in fact they make this? I use the 10oz setting on my Keurig and this is just right for me. For those who like a strong cup then they might want the smaller setting. I have had a few guests ask me what kind of coffee this was as they really liked it. Must be a low acid blend as it never upsets my stomach even after 5 cups. Very smooth taste. I'm not a coffee connoisseur but after tasting so many different K-cups I can tell you this one is one of the best.,Nice and smooth no bitter taste!
"summarize: Imported from Istanbul, Turkey, Koska halva is absolutely the best and completely outdoes the competition. Personally I prefer the pistachio or chocolate varities to the plain, but all three taste wonderful. The plastic containers keep it nice and fresh. A word to the wise: this Middle Eastern treat is so outrageously good that it is hard to stop eating it. Cut yourself a quarter-inch thick slice and then put the container away immediately, otherwise you will yield to the temptation of cutting more and more slices. Also, try to control yourself and eat it once a day. Needless to say, halva goes great with strong Turkish coffee and the two together will give you quite a burst of energy. The only way you could do better than Koska is to get real homemade halva which not easily available. Enjoy!",The best halva is the best!
"summarize: I ordered this as extra & recieved it on time & at door. When I opened the cans my cats were READY! BUT, what came out was a mushy mess & the cats even knew something wasent right!

"summarize: While I cannot speak of the ""muscle recovery"" effect of this product or any measureable way to decide if it actually helps or not, I can say for certain that it tastes very good, especially if you are a chocolate lover.  Normally, I would prefer a drink much higher in protein content and lower in calories after a workout.  Unfortunately, that often means artificial sweeteners and other relatively unsavory ingredients (imo).  reGen is sweetened with good old sugar.  The protein source is isolated milk protein (whey), not soy, and that's good because I wouldn't touch soy with a ten foot pole.  The rich chocolate flavor comes from real cocoa of all things, and it really makes reGen taste GREAT!  Additionally, reGen is 99.9% lactose free if lactose is a problem for you.  Shake it up and drink this stuff cold out of the fridge and it tastes just like a rich chocolate milk, only better.  What a treat after a workout or mowing the lawn!",Unsure of the muscle recovery benefits.  Positive it tastes great though!
"summarize: Being a Bob's Red Mill fan, I bought <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDM772"">Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a> on a whim to try it. I have a bread machine, but hadn't used it it a long while (like many folks, I suspect). Plus, I have been watching carbs but I love bread. If you are a fan of low-carb bread (if it's possible to be a fan of anything low-carb), I think you will enjoy this product.  It produces a large loaf of fluffy, light but a bit chewy bread -- great for slicing or tearing up by hand.  It has a nice wheaty taste and doesn't have that cardboardy consistency/taste that many low-carb products have. It uses half-and-half as one of its ingredients, which I think makes it fluffy.  My only quibble: I have a two-pound bread machine and the bread consistently overflows the top of the machine at the end of the baking cycle -- creating a mushroom-like top to the loaf. So, the top is a bit underdone. I am going to try baking it in the regular oven the next time and see if that is better.  Again, Bob's Red Mill products aren't cheap, but they are very high quality and the four packages produce four large loaves of bread that stay fresh for quite a while and travel well. (I often tuck one into my suitcase when I travel.)","Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb Bread Mix -- Good Product, Worth Breaking Out the Bread Machine For"
"summarize: An eco-conscious competitor to Nespresso? YAY, I thought, this would be good. And it sort of is.<br /><br />The packaging is great as it gets away from Nestle's use of we-don't-care-about-the-planet metal (aluminum?). Five stars for that.<br /><br />On the other hand, the coffee isn't so great. I bought these without a review and without much information about what type I was buying -- I guess I'm a maverick like that (ha). Although I got them on time, and had apparently purchased an espresso that was considered 4 out of 5 in strength, it really tasted like a 1.5 out of 5 in strength. So, I'm NOT impressed with the coffee -- and I am NOT a coffee expert.<br /><br />Bottom line is, I might try them again if I can find out which espresso is strongest. And, I might try them again because I hate the planet-hating, overpriced monopoly that Nestle has on Nespresso pods... but I gotta say that Nestle's Nespresso pods are tastier.<br /><br />So would some entrepreneur mind doing something about this dilemma?

"summarize: The best balsamic vinegar for the money, bar none.  I have used balsamic vinegar for over twenty years along with regular red wine vinegars for my different salads, but until I found Academia Barilla I had no idea what a difference an aged, thick, dense, aromatic vinegar could make. It comes the closest to privately made balsamic vinegar I've enjoyed in Modena, Italy. Compared to other ""industrially made"" vinegars that are watery, transparent, lacking in intensity, and, needless to say, much cheaper, Academia Barilla is superior to all of them for its artisanal quality. Unless one wants to pay anywhere from 30 to 100 dollars for artisanal balsamic vinegar from Modena, Academia Barilla at slightly over 10 dollars is definitely worth the price.",Academia Barilla Balsamic vinegar of modena
"summarize: My daughter is now 7 months old, and I only now am getting time to write a review :) but these are my FAVORITE GoPicnics! I have at least 5 in my car at any one time, one in the diaper bag and I throw one or two in the stroller, when we go on long walks because I constantly need the calories (I am breastfeeding), and when she is sleeping in her carseat and I want something healthier than drivethru, and don't want to wake her up to go in anywhere, these save my bacon. I usually start with the surprisingly sweet and salty chocolate and move on to the salami then cheese and crackers (carefully balancing ratios), saving the nut mix until the end. Even if the chocolate melts in the car, it is still yummy :). These really come in handy when my grand food plans have fallen through because she is still not sleeping through the night... but that is another story...",Healthy tasty meal for a breastfeeding new mommy
"summarize: We used to buy these mixed berries and they were fantastic--all you tasted was fruit, and there was no extra sweetening.  Sadly, the manufacturer has changed them, making sugar the SECOND item in the ingredient list, and adding OIL--the two of which combine to form a sickly sweet sort of syrup. This not only makes the berries a mess to eat, it also means that when you first taste them, what you taste is the sugar, nothing else.<br /><br />Hopefully this manufacturer will wake up and realize that we are all trying to avoid extra sugar in our diets, and they are doing us no favors at all by adding sugar and oil to what should be purely fruit.  The change is not good for us and not wanted--what more do they need to hear?",This product has changed--for the worse!
"summarize: Imagine doggie treat flavored underarm deodorant.... have to squeeze just a bit to get the roller wet, then turn upside down and let the dog lick it. Unique idea.  Would probably be useful as a training tool. Our dog definitely likes it.  I imagine this works best as a daily treat. I shudder to think what would happen if you let the roller dry out, dog ends up with a tounge rash trying to push the roller past the dried out spot... or worse, squeeze to hard and drip doggie treat juice all over!!

"summarize: Absolutely LOVE this toy. We recently purchased this for our 8 month old French Bulldog after our trainer suggested feeding him by hand to prevent him from gobbling up his meals in 2 seconds as Frenchies do. While that's great in theory, there are many times we just can't sit and feed him his kibble bit by bit. We tried several Kong type products and he was able to either get his food out too quickly or grew bored and never ate. This toy makes him really work for his food and because he can see the food through the tube it really keeps his interest. My only gripe is that the plastic tube could be more sturdy. I love that it's see through but his jaws of steel have already done some damage to it, but perhaps we just need to experiment with a larger size (we have the small now) We've only had it a short time so I can't speak too much for longevity but for now it is an amazing solution.",Amazing toy for dogs who devour their food quickly
"summarize: The Alaskan pink salmon cannot be more than 3 years old while the Alaskan sockeye salmon can be up to 8 years old.  More Alaskan pink salmon is harvested each year (by weight) than all other Alaskan salmon species put together.  Thus, pink salmon is the smallest, youngest, and most plentiful of the Alaskan salmon.  This means that you will probably save a huge amount of money and also get slightly more delicious salmon skin inside of each can than you would from canned Alaskan sockeye salmon.  True, one can of Alaskan sockeye salmon has more fat than one can of Alaskan pink salmon.  The meat of the Alaskan sockeye is higher in fat and higher in the beneficial carotenoid, astaxanthin, which gives salmon, trout, crabs, lobsters, shrimp, krill, flamingos, and some bacteria their red or pink color.  Yes, the canned sockeye is slightly better than the canned pink but the price is almost twice as high.  Interestingly, Masahide Kaeriyama compared the stomach contents of the Alaskan pink salmon against the stomach contents of the Alaskan sockeye salmon and discovered that:  (1)both species of salmon are eating almost the exact same things when in the ocean, (2)squid is the favorite food of both species of salmon, comprising about one-fourth to one-third of their total diet, (3)red krill (a euphausiid) comprises less than 10% of the total diet of both species of salmon, (4)fishes comprise only about 5% of the total diet of both species of salmon, and (5)copepods, amphipods, decapods, pteropods, octopods, euphausiids, polychaetes, chaetognaths, ostracods, halocypridids, cumacea, gelatinous zooplankton, and barnacles were also found in the stomachs of both the Alaskan pink salmon and the Alaskan sockeye salmon.  Because of different DNA, however, 1 pound of Alaskan sockeye salmon meat has 18.33mg of astaxanthin but 1 pound of Alaskan pink salmon meat has only 2.45mg of astaxanthin.  Average amounts of astaxanthin contained in 1 pound of other salmon species:  2.55mg for Alaskan chum (keta, silverbrite) salmon, 6.26mg for Alaskan coho (silver) salmon, 4.04mg for Alaskan king (chinook) salmon, and 2.40mg for wild Atlantic salmon.  Finally, wild salmon is considered even healthier for us to eat than farmed salmon, partly because wild salmon has better omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid ratios than farmed salmon.  The average omega-3 to omega-6 ratios are as follows:  farmed Atlantic salmon 2.55 to 1, wild Atlantic salmon 11.72 to 1, canned wild Alaskan sockeye salmon 10.94 to 1, canned wild Alaskan pink salmon 12.74 to 1, wild Alaskan chum salmon 12.31 to 1, wild Alaskan coho salmon 7.15 to 1, and smoked Alaskan king salmon (lox) 1.11 to 1.","If you can't afford canned Alaskan Sockeye Salmon, then canned Alaskan Pink Salmon has advantages"

It was an easy starting point for all kinds of lovely seafood soups and sauces for nights when I was desperate for something fast and delicious.  Over the past few months, one supermarked chain after another in my area stopped carrying it. Totally unavailable, even by special order.  I was getting desperate.  So I tried Amazon.

I know some people enjoy it with milk or fruit but I find I like it prepared as a savory dish just like grits (or polenta). I load this up with a little salt and a lot of black pepper, and I am good to go.  It has some of the same textural qualities as grits and I've even fried it up like I would leftover grits/polenta (served with some honey drizzled over it).<br /><br />Like others, I also find that if I have this for breakfast I'm not hungry for hours afterward, unlike grain-based breakfasts.<br /><br />It can be difficult to find so I'm glad Amazon has made it available in a 4-pack!","Love it!

"summarize: This product is made in Canada. The ingredients listed on the label are: ""Sugar, palm oil, hazelnuts, cocoa, skim milk, reduced minerals whey (milk), lecithin as emulsifier (soy), vanillin, an artificial flavor.""<br /><br />The label also states: ""Made with over 50 hazelnuts per jar.

My five year old son is a very picky eater, and he loves this product.  We use this on pancakes because he has a sugar issue.

Considering that no-so-hot flavors like strawberry continued I eventually concluded that not enough people knew what ""Streusel"" was and didn't try it.<br /><br />I was astounded to find Streusel available on Amazon but I was suspicious that they were now called ""Cinnamon Streusel"".

People that say they eat these out of the bag are crazy!<br /><br />However, once you put them in something sweetened, like yogurt or candies or cookie dough, etc....you will never go back to ""chocolate chips"" again.<br /><br />These look like little pieces of the cacao pod.  They are crunchy.  And they STAY crunchy when you mix them in foods.  I haven't cooked them yet, but I have mixed them in with my peanut butter, coconut oil, coconut shreds refrigerator candy and they give them a little crunch!  As long as your recipe is slightly sweetened, you will love these.<br /><br />I actually didn't use mine for almost a year as I was put off by the taste.  Now that I figured out how to use them, I will put them in anything sweet I make!  Love them.  They keep forever just about also.

"summarize: I usually purchase this from my neighborhood Whole Foods Store. I saw it on here for a comparable price and was going to order something anyway and added it to my order. I started purchasing this brand because it has no alcohol base unlike a lot of the other brands that I have tried, it's more reasonably priced, it doesn't seem (at least to me) to have that bitter aftertaste as strongly as some others and a little goes a long way. I use this in everything, even baking.<br /><br />I noticed also that they sell a granulated ""no bitterness"" baking blend of this brand on Amazon and will have to give that a go as well.

"summarize: May 26th: New update I just received a new shipment of these nuts but they lacked the chili pepper to make them hot. Fortunately, Amazon is making it right but I am saddened by this problem with planters.<br /><br />Jan 8, 2012: Update, for a while in 2011 there were bad patches of these nuts where for some reason the hot chili pepper was missing making the flavor subpar - there are several reviews mentioning this and I have personally experienced a few of these packs which I could not enjoy. Anyway, last week I received my latest Subscribe and Save order from Amazon and I am pleased to report that the tried and true recipe was used for that batch - dated best by 7-31-12.<br /><br />My favorite snack is nuts, particularly pistachios, almonds, cashews and peanuts - Yes, I know peanuts are not nuts but a legume. This particular variety of planters nuts are my favorite and can be hard to find, especially now that they have all these new designer flavors, most of which I just don't like at all. Chipotle has an aftertaste I don't enjoy and the other new flavors are too strong or too salty. The regular, honey roasted and heat nuts are the only varieties I enjoy. Heat nuts are not too hot, but certainly not mild. The hot spices heat up the taste of a roasted peanut instead of masking it.<br /><br />Nuts are far more nutritious than potato chips or pretzels which are mostly empty calories. Nuts are also loaded with fat, good fat, which makes you feel full instead of spiking your insulin levels like non-fat snacks do. But keep in mind a few nuts contain plenty of calories and it is easy to just keeping eating your way to the next size pants. The good news is that each packet, about 300 calories, makes for good portion control. Eat one pack and stop. Amazon has a great price and free shipping.

"summarize: Coconut water is high in potassium and a natural electrolyte.  It helps to rehydrate you much faster than Gatorade only wishes it could.  Depending on what you are used to drinking, you may love or hate coconut water.  I think that it's a matter of getting used to a different taste more than it being ""bad"" or ""gross.""  If you go into it thinking you're going to be drinking juice, think again.  This is more a watered down juice-like drink, but it has much less sugar and doesn't give a sugar shock that leaves you wishing for more to drink.<br /><br />My whole family enjoys this brand and this specific flavor combo.  We all do not enjoy plain ole coconut water and really liked the juice-like taste of this flavor.  It works for us, but your family may enjoy another flavor better.

We both had the same reaction...""this doesn't taste as good as the brand we had been drinking.""  Hence my coming to Amazon tonight to write a review of the O.N.E. product...  Now I wish I hadn't ordered 3 whole boxes of it!  I thought @ $10/box of 12 I couldn't go wrong.  Hmm, maybe I was wrong!<br /><br />But enough of O.N.E.

Just wish there were more flavors to choose from...<br /><br />However, we've stopped buying this product based on Amazon's RIDICULOUS amount of packaging for it.  One of the reason I liked this product was that I felt greener using a baby food without the glass jars.  However, in order to ship 32 packets of powder, Amazon put the 4 small boxes of 8 powder packets into a bigger box, surrounded the bigger box with plastic padding, and put that box inside an even bigger box!  As if they were worried the powder packets would break?!  See the attached picture.  We bought it ~4 times and same over-kill packaging every time.

"summarize: I tried this one and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004051BLS"">Yogi Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> at the same time.  Well, not in the same cup at the same time, but within the same week.  This one can't compare to the mint one.  Maybe since my palate likes black tea over green.  I can smell the great scent of vanilla and ginger, but something is lost in the taste.  It could be that too many flavors are coming to this party.  There are two types of red tea, then green tea and also Assam black tea in this. There are some herbs that make me laugh, like Shank Pushpi and then oddly trademarked ingredients like L-Theanine Suntheanine.  I have to watch this one when it brews. The other one I tried, the mint, doesn't get bitter if you let it brew too long, this one almost has to be brewed at the minimum time stated on the package, which is four minutes, in order for it to taste the best.  I don't like the flavor of this without sugar.  It's a bit too astringent.  Again, that might be the weird mix of green and red teas, along with herbs and ingredients I haven't ran across before now.  It packs even more caffeine than the mint tea, 80mg when a cup of coffee has 90mg.  It's strong stuff.<br />Overall, I got this box to review and will drink it merrily with a bit of sugar in it, watching closely to make sure I don't overbrew it.  I can't use the bags over again, it's way too  bitter.  I don't think I'd buy a box of this because the flavor isn't that interesting to me, even though it has a lot of the spices and herbs I enjoy in teas -- cinnamon, licorice, natural vanilla flavor, vanilla bean, chai spice, ginger -- I don't get why I don't like this as much as I feel I should.  Perhaps there is too much of everything in this tea, making none of the herbs or teas stick out so it is has a lackluster taste.  It isn't horrible, but it's all the memorable either.  It does energize me, but I am not sure if it is because I just drank the tea version of coffee or if I am getting any benefit from the weird mix of herbs, spices and other ingredients.","The perfect energy might be coming from the caffeine boost, instead of the herbs!  It also doesn't have much flavor."

"summarize: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ENWSBW"">Larabar, Bar Cherry Pie, 1.7-Ounce (16 Pack)</a><br /><br />Oh My!!!  The Cherry Pie Larabar reminds me of the cherry pies my mother used to make.  They are not overly sweet (like the store-bought pies made these days) and the tart cherry flavor really comes through.  I must admit I had my doubts when I first opened the wrapper, because the Larabar did not look very appealing.  Don't let looks fool you...this bar is delicious!!<br /><br />I first purchased a variety of Larabars at a local store to try them out.  Once I found the Cherry Pie bars, I decided to purchase a whole box of them through Amazon to save money.  An unexpected bonus was that the bars I received through Amazon.com were much softer (and fresher) than those bought locally.",Cherry Pie Larabar Reminds Me of Childhood
"summarize: At first bite, this turned off 4 of us.  The kids, who are veggie nuts, and eat raw spinach by the handful, did not care for the snacks at all.  The adults kept nibbling, thinking it might get more palatable with time.  We eventually decided to try it as a snack with red wine, as the slightly salty slightly bitter taste might blend really well with a hearty wine.<br /><br />I expected more judging from the other reviews, and I guess I should have just seen ""spinach and kale"" and realized that I should not have bought 24 bags to try something new.  Still, it's not awful -- just a bit odd.  Perhaps I will test mixing it with the caramel booty!","Odd, but it grows on you a bit"
"summarize: I've used liquid and paste color in the past and this product seems to be somewhere in between.  I had to use quite a bit of the substance to achieve the color I was looking for.  In paste colors, you get a dramatic result with just a drop.  The Ateco are quite a bit better than the liquid color, and, for the price, it's probably about right.<br /><br />The bottom line - You get what you pay for.  If you want dramatic colors, you can achieve that using a good portion of the bottle.  If you want subtle colors, this may be what you're looking for.",Better than liquid color - not as good as paste
"summarize: My husband and I bounce back and forth between Schar and Ancient Harvest for gluten free pastas. Schar is more similar to standard pasta in taste, and we love the penne shape, but we haven't figured out the trick for reheating it. (It doesn't taste or feel right reheated for some reason. We tend to throw the leftover sauce on top - so maybe keeping them separate and adding water to the pasta dish will help.)<br /><br />If you're looking to try a different brand though -- one that reheats normally -- I recommend Ancient Harvest e.g. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTBDQ"">Ancient Harvest Quinoa Organic Pasta Gluten Free, Elbows, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />Hope this helps!",Tastes like real pasta! (Tricky to reheat)
"summarize: My kitten--now a hefty 11 pound slug--went through the same antics as the 1-star review written about Bean.<br /><br />I couldn't figure out why our Tiki was always hungry.  Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because ""it's good for the cats and they love it"". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to ""fatten her up"" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet.","Science Diet = terrible for cats, it's addictive"
"summarize: I ate it right out of the pouch -- it was crunchy, sweet and the chocolate chips (squares) were not overpowering. There were no nuts, no extra crunchy clusters of anything, nothing gooey in it -- just simple and sweet.<br /><br />Then I put some in a bowl and added cold water - little rice krispie-type bits floated to the top but eventually mixed in with the rest of the granola -- it was all very tasty, toothsome, and filling.<br /><br />I put some in another bowl and added hot water -- it tasted more like oatmeal with chocolate chips, and did not have the hot crunchy surprise elements of regular hot granola -- a mild disappointment to me, but no cereal can be all things to all people.<br /><br />The ingredients are simple -- oatmeal, choc chips, sugar, cocoa butter (with 10% saturated fat and 220 Calories per 1/2 cup serving, this is definitely not a low-cal granola -- but Granola has never been known to be low-cal), brown rice products, molasses, Vitamin E.<br /><br />Tasty, and nutritious, and a good source of Copper (15% per 1/2 cup serving).<br /><br />So I like Back To Nature Chocolate Delight Granola best when it is either eaten out of hand or in cold water/coffee/even tea. The pouch is great for long-term storage in a cool place and can go with me wherever I go to give me a good energy boost or just to act as comfort food.",This is the perfect Granola for me
"summarize: I've long been a fan of the Haribo gummi bears, and in fact won't even eat most other gummy bears. We had friends in Germany that sent us bags of them every year for Christmas and they always bring back fond memories of childhood. While 5 pounds is a LOT of candy, I thought I'd tried these bears from Amazon as they were a good price with the free shipping. Unfortunately I found them to be considerably harder and more difficult to chew than the Haribos you generally get in the smaller gold bags (or the 1 pound bags our friends would send us). Not sure why this is, and the flavor is otherwise okay. But they definitely do not seem to be quite the same quality and I have to wonder if there is a storage issue or some other problem at Amazon that is causing it as I see other reviewers have mentioned it as well. Still, even harder than normal these beat other gummi bears and hopefully with proper storage at home won't get any harder. I doubt I would buy them again from here though but would stick with other sources I've used online and/or locally that provide better quality.",A bit harder and more stale than Haribos generally are
"summarize: I was disappointed with this malt powder. It really doesn't have a very strong malt flavor. The Carnation Malt powder you can buy in the grocery store is far superior taste wise to this product. You have to use an amazing amount of this stuff to get close to tasting ""malty"". So, today I bought a jar of the Carnation at the store to add to this so it doesn't go to waste. Sorry Kegworks, this is just more like instant milk flavor than a true ""MALT"" flavor. By the way, the Carnation is also cheaper than this. Postage was way too high, but I didn't mind paying it expecting to get a superior product.",Not as good as I expected....
"summarize: I love these bags already.  I have been using them for about a week and am in love with the product.  I had been using the lansinoh and medela bags.  I love the medela because you can pump right into them but I find them very expensive. I needed an alternative.  I took a chance and chose these bags.  I like them because they hold 6 oz of milk, are biodegradable, tamper resistant and have an easy pour spout.  The only thing they need is to have an adapter so that you can pump directly into the bag.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/12/11<br />I happened to get to the last few bags in one of my boxes of 25 (out of 75) and noticed several pin sized holes in the bottom of at least 3 bags.  I discovered the holes because I added milk to the bag and noticed milk at the bottom, I wiped it away and noticed the drop kept coming back.  When i squeezed the bag to determine where the hole was I noticed 4 small holes in the bottom. i poured the milk into another bag and the same thing happened.  Tried it again and it happened.  I poured the milk in a bottle and put it in the fridge.  I've decided to stop using these temporarily as I can't afford to waste milk.  I was so excited about this product now I'm sad.  Maybe I should contact the manufacturer.  I also wonder because I have 72 frozen bags that I'll have to carefully defrost.",I love these bags already!!!!! -- had to update
"summarize: Newman's is a brand that I'm used to hearing on fig bars, prunes, and other things much healthier than chocolate, so I wasn't sure how good their chocolate was going to be.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find that not only was their chocolate very fancy, but it was also very smooth and not as bitter as other dark chocolates.<br /><br />The packaging, as you can see from the picture on the description page, is very ornately designed, and the bar is the same.  It is divided into sixths, and on each sixth there is an engraved N.<br /><br />The taste, which I was very surprised at, wasn't bitter like Hershey's dark chocolate tends to be, but it wasn't too sweet.  It was just the right bittersweet mixture!  Also, on top of this, it had a very creamy texture, much like milk chocolate would.<br /><br />In one 2.25 ounce bar, there are 330 calories, so I wouldn't necessarily describe this as a healthy snack, but all of the ingredients are organic, making it more nutritious than your average chocolate bar.<br /><br />Overall, it is a deliciously different type of dark chocolate bar that I recommend to all chocoholics (like me).","Fancy, creamy, and not too bitter!"
"summarize: The concept is good. I love the plain/original Oskri coconut bars. They have a nice texture. I like Mounds and wanted a slightly healthier version. These could be that, but this box was way below quality. It seems like it is old because most of the bars I have tried have discolored chocolate and the coconut is dried out. One of the bars even had a bad seal so that I didn't even have to rip it open and it was completely dried out. The plain bars are not dry at all, so these really did not meet the standards I was expecting. Won't buy these again, but that is probably best because the sugar content is high, even though it is superior to corn syrup.",Disappointed with this box of bars
"summarize: I buy most of my groceries from a discount-outlet store.  I can always find some good and cheap jam/jellies there.<br /><br />But this is a step up.  The blueberries in here are real.  It takes me back 40 years to when I ate wild blueberries off the bushes in Maine.<br />The mixture is sweet, but the blueberry taste comes through.  Its not like flavored sugar.<br /><br />There is no better review I can give than to say I'm willing to pay the price for these preserves.  There are rather few products I can say that about.<br /><br />As another reviewer of a related product says, this and some natural peanut butter make for a great sandwich.<br /><br />As an experienced giant warehouse store shopper, I'm buying more while they have it.  The product I bought 6/08 is ""good"" until 3/10, but being preserves would last even longer -- but it's not long for this world anyways, since it's so good.",From a cheapskate -- its worth the money
"summarize: If you're going to be out-and-about with a bottle of water, this might be a good addition just to give it some variety and taste.<br /><br />I gave this a three-star review when I first tried it. I thought it was okay, but nothing special. It tastes fine. Other reviewers have noticed a bit of an aftertaste, and I agree. I wouldn't say it's unpleasant, but it's present.<br /><br />But, over time I've used the whole bottle, and it's grown on me. It is pretty refreshing, and adds a good boost to a normal glass of water. So I went from ""okay"" to actually liking it. So I boosted it to four stars.<br /><br />The flavor does avoid that chemical taste that some of these enhancers seem to have.<br /><br />The vitamins are a benefit, though I'm never sure if the benefit offsets the chemicals and sucralose ingredients.<br /><br />I noticed no extra 'energy,' but I don't really notice when I drink a soda either. It's just sort of 'there.' Which is better than being jittery, and since this has taurine, like Red Bull, I was wondering about that - did not happen, though, and that's good. Ultimately, 'energy' is subjective and difficult to define from person to person.<br /><br />The drink does at least some of what it says it will do - it gives flavor to water, and apparently does provide vitamins. It tastes pretty good, and adds some life to boring tap water. But, if you're caffeine-sensitive, it's probably best used in morning and early afternoon.<br /><br />As I said, I've updated this as of July 15, from my original three stars to four stars.","It's decent - okay taste, and some vitamins"
"summarize: The KIND HEALTHY GRAINS CINNAMON OAT CLUSTERS is a great way to get a little extra fiber and flax seed into your diet. It tastes pretty good right out of the bag and it goes great with milk as a cereal.<br /><br />I really have no complaints about it except that some of the flax seeds get stuck in between my teeth and so rinsing my mouth is a must.<br /><br />KIND HEALTHY GRAINS CINNAMON OAT CLUSTERS has a semi-sweet flavor, so it's not overly sweet and has a nice nutty/granola flavor. Also, the bag has a zip-lock seal so you can keep it stored in the bag.<br /><br />I'm going to try the other flavors, but I recommend this treat for those trying to get more whole grains into their diet.",*Tasty* By Itself Or With Milk.
"summarize: I had hoped to save some money on our coffee fetish of drinking only Peruvian grown beans by subscribing to Amazon's program for getting one 5 pound bag of Peruvian beans every two months but two of three bags of beans were so stale I had to throw them out. When this last bag arrived and I opened it, I knew right away it was bad. It smelled like plastic instead of the wonderful aroma of fresh roasted coffee beans, and the beans look stale. So I have cancelled my subscription and will go back to ordering our beans from our local organic food buying club through UNFI. This was an expensive trial, having gotten $100 worth of worthless beans.","Cafe Altura Peruvian Coffee is the best in the World, except;"
"summarize: In my opinion this is the best and only seasoning to buy for jerking your meats, it is spicy, easy to use and the absolute authentic jerk seasoning I will swear by. I have used this on all types of chicken and some other meats, I would not reccomend this for fish,unless you are going to pan sear the fish, fish is too delicate for this, try their marinade instead. This seasonig is not for the faint of heart, it is very hot and spicy just the way i like it. Try this only if you like your food hot and spicy, the seasoning works very well on the grill.",The only jerk seasoning to buy
"summarize: After hearing that this cereal has been a long-time favorite in England, I was eager to give it a try.<br /><br />Kellogg's Crunchy Nut - Golden Honey Nut does have a lot of flavor in every bite - you can taste the honey and nuts, in good balance. Make no mistake, this may not be the full-on sugar taste of Frosted Flakes, but this is a sweet-tasting cereal.<br /><br />I was surprised to read afterwards that the nuts are actually peanuts, because there certainly isn't a strong peanut flavor. But people with peanut allergies be warned!<br /><br />I'm one who likes my cereal a bit healthier and less-sweet, though. If you compare this to plain, unsweetened Cheerios, at the same 3/4-cup serving size you're getting 50% more calories (120 vs. 80). It would take 3 teaspoons of sugar to equal that with the Cheerios!<br /><br />Although it stays crispy, Kellogg's Crunchy Nut does get soggy fairly quickly, which is not my taste.<br /><br />So I guess the question is - when choosing your first meal of the day - how nutty and sweet do you want to be?",how nutty and sweet do you want to be?
summarize: I took advantage of a promotion on a 12 pack of these after seeing all the good reviews. I am used to using green tea that comes in the tea bags and drink several cups per day so I was excited to see if I would like these. I just opened one and drank a little bit and the first thought that came to mind is rancid. I don't know whether I got a bad batch or not but it tastes nothing like I thought it would. I thought I would get a light tasting traditional green tea but instead took in a mouthful of funky tasting fermented-like liquid. It even smells bad. I somehow will have to stomach power my way through 11 more of these. I don't know if I have the stomach for it....,Terrible- Is this Green Tea or Kambucha?
summarize: Mum mums are easy to feed our infant- he can do it himself! He stuffs these things in!<br /><br />They can get a little messy (like all infant food) and stick into things when wet.  If you clean them up while wet- no problem- but if they dry into clothes or the carpet they are pain.<br /><br />They taste pretty good (better than infant cereal!)and even my toddler asks for them- and in a pinch I've snacked on a few too.<br /><br />The only problem-  the packaging.  I ordered them by the 6 box case and more than half the crackers are broken.  The box was just the individual boxes of rusks in a cardboard case-- no padding.<br />Its very frustrating because the long shape is one of the reasons they are so easy for my 6 month old to feed himself. The pieces end up dropped much more easily than the original shape.<br /><br />Overall rating for the product= 5<br />for the condition in which they arrived- 3.,"We love them, but a lot are broken"
"summarize: Yogi Tea's Pomegranate Green Tea has been my favorite tea for years and years, and when my local grocery store stopped carrying this flavor, I started ordering it from Amazon by the case.  It's a good value (cheaper here than at Whole Foods!), but as much as I love this tea, a case of it lasts a long time, and at some point in the months between when I ordered the previous case and my last order, the company sneakily changed the recipe!<br /><br />I thought the flavor was a little off, so I compared the ingredient list on the new box to the list on my last old box, and there was one difference.  Both lists included ""pomegranate flavor,"" but the ""powdered pomegranate juice"" from the old box's ingredient list (also here on Amazon's ingredient list) is missing from the new box!  (I checked the Yogi Tea website, and their info confirms the change -- there's no more actual pomegranate juice in the tea at all.)  I assume real flavoring from a real food became too expensive...  So disappointing!<br /><br />I loved this tea because it wasn't super-sweet like all the other pomegranate green teas out there.  The tartness of pomegranate showed through the added stevia, and there was just a tiny touch of peppermint tossed in to make the flavor really bright -- it was refreshing iced!  The new formula/recipe is sweeter and flatter in flavor and the tartness is more... harsh.  Perhaps other people will still love it, but if you're here like me looking for your old favorite, consider yourself warned!!",Disappointing Reformulation -- Ingredient List Here Inaccurate
"summarize: I've tried this low-sodium variety and it had a surprisingly ""peppery"" taste that I did not care for. Also, you can reduce the sodium content of other flavors by only using half or two-thirds of the seasoning packet. You will get more flavor, but end up consuming as much sodium - sometimes even less, depending on the variety - than you would if you ate this low-sodium kind  with its entire seasoning packet.<br /><br />Ramen has an unfair bad reputation. Use less of the seasoning, add some leftover frozen vegetables, maybe toss in pieces of leftover chicken or cooked bacon, and you've gotten a decent small meal. I'm not saying that you should live off of Ramen only, but Ramen recipes have gotten my husband and I through some financially-tough months in the past.",Why not just reduce the sodium of regular flavors?
"summarize: I discovered this great product about several months ago and since then have consumed a jar or two of it every month. I love it and order it by the case now. I use it almost daily, and sometimes more than once a day. It isn't peanut butter but it has a nutty taste and mixed with some of the Walden fruit spreads (raspberry, strawberry and apple seem to work best) it makes a great peanut butter/jelly taste to use on crackers, bread, etc. The consistency is pretty firm although not as thick as regular peanut butter it's perfectly acceptable (to me). The color is fine a bit darker than regular peanut butter (not that you can taste color - but it does influence people's opinion). I rarely take the time to write product reviews and was shocked when I came here to look for another Walden product to find that so many people had left negative reviews of this product and felt compelled to leave a more positive opinion. I think if you like Diet Coke and understand that it's not regular Coke than you will understand this product isn't Peanut Butter but just as Diet Coke is a good substitute for Coke and saves you about 200 calories a serving that this ""Peanut Spread"" is a good alternative to regular peanut butter and will save you about 200 calories a serving (2 Tablespoons).",Minority Opinion - But I LOVE This Spread
"summarize: I agree with other reviews regarding the very high spice levels in this syrup.  I normally like a lot of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, etc but this syrup had too much for me.  The syrup smells like it will have more pumpkin flavor, but that is not delivered in taste.<br /><br />Amended review 10/25/12 : This company is better at customer service than any other consumer food company I have dealt with.  Perhaps it is due to the strong customer orientation in the part of their business selling high end products to bakeries, food service operations and food companies.  I got a call the same day as I filed my original review.  On that call I learned that their syrups are more concentrated so I need to make sure I go easy on the pumps.  Because they are concentrated and less sweet,  they have only 35 calories per serving which is much less than other syrups and makes it easier to use on my greek yogurt.  I also learned they are working on a third version of a pumpkin syrup which says a lot about how responsive they are to consumer feedback.  To make sure I understood they make high quality products, they also sent me some samples of their other lines which were all very tasty.<br /><br />So if you see a product from Amoretti that you are interested in, give it a try.  It is probably very good.  If it turns out the flavor is not to your liking, the company will make it right as they did for me.","Lots of spice, not much pumpkin, but wow great customer service"

They're small, but not bite size (unless you have a big dog), freeze-dried pieces of salmon that's great for giving as treats. They have that strong fishy-scent that dogs love, so your furry child will be able to find them with no problem.<br /><br />The reason I took off one-star is because the treats are hard to break apart. Since they're freeze-dried, when trying to break into smaller pieces the KISSES will splinter and shred, which makes it hard to give a small quick bite for a reward during training. Even if you were to break them apart before hand, the treats still shred so it's hard to get small bite sized pieces.<br /><br />Also, if your pooch is able to get the whole treat in his/her mouth, it still has to be chewed, taking time away from focus, if you're using as a training aid. Other than that the treats are great.",*Quality* Product But Hard To Break!
"summarize: I got some of these strawberry candies as a gift... and I should note they were NOT from Amazon and there were 6 months before they expired.<br /><br />I could not believe how terrible they were. It's as if each candy has absorbed some terrible plastic taste... something I smelled when I first opened the bag.

After it's used, the urine sticks to the bottom of the litter pan so much that I really struggled to clean the litterbox! Feces were barely covered up and the odor control is non-existent. In fact, after one day of use, there was a strange sour smell that filled the room from this litter. This was even after the box was clean.

I will be trying World's Best litter next and definitely won't buy this again.",Not as good as I had hoped.
"summarize: My initial review of this product was rejected due to my use of profanity (implied, anyway).  Yes, I used profanity to describe eating this cereal because it is that GOOD!  So here is my more ""tasteful"" version of my review of a fantastic product!<br /><br />This cereal is incredibly delicious. Like eating a bowl of candy.<br /><br />Is it sweet? YES<br /><br />Is it packed full of chocolate? YES<br /><br />Is it nutritionally similar to other cereals?

"summarize: This flavor has an overwhelming peanut, i.e. peanut butter flavor with a tart, fruity flavor reminding me of a PB&J sandwich.  I didn't enjoy it but that may be because I don't like peanut butter.  Too many peanuts (""nuts"" to me doesn't mean a majority of peanuts) and too tart of fruit, too pasty texture of fruit as well as too much of it.  I prefer nutty with no peanuts and chewy, sweeter fruit pieces.  My bars were fresh and chewy (a tad on the soft side).  I'd picked up various flavors at small local stores and enjoyed them so grabbed this when it went on sale to try.  I'll not buy this flavor again but do recommend the brand.",I like Kind bars but not this flavor

After reading several reviews I thought that I would give Mangia Carmelina Italian chopped tomatoes a try and what a difference. The chopped tomatoes are a bit saucy, but the tomato puree they are in is perfect for making a nice sauce.  I enjoy the chopped tomatoes because I can make up a great sauce for my pasta in about 30 minutes.  If you want more tomato in your product then I would suggest you  try Mangia Carmelina's whole tomatoes in puree.  The puree is so rich in either one that you will not need to add tomato paste to thicken it. I would definitely recommend these products.",What a difference a tomato makes
"summarize: For my dog:<br />I have been using this oil for a couple weeks now on & off.  I have just started giving it to my dog (who has been limping & having trouble rising from a sitting & laying position)for about a week now.  HE LOVES IT!  He can't wait to get his dog treat in the morning with it smeared on one side and in the afternoon it is the first thing he eats out of his food (I put about a tablespoon sized dollop on top of his dry dog food).  I have definitely noticed an improvement in his mobility & his coat seems to be much softer.  I had also done some research & found out that it will eliminate stinky dog breath!  I can't wait for that to happen. It is safe for cats too... If you want to know more about giving it to your pets, just do a Google search using the words ""coconut oil for my pets"" and plenty of info will be at your fingertips! :)<br /><br />For my kids:<br />I have done extensive research on Coconut oil & the benefits it has on our bodies. I can tell you that the antiviral benefit it has definitely works. My son (recently turned 12)just recently had a virus that included coughing, a sore throat and had caused him to break out in a rash that only spread onto one side of his body... Doctor said it had to run it's course.  I started giving him some of this oil on toast with the normal butter & cinnamon sugar & within a couple days he started getting better. We stopped giving him the oil & he got sick again... So we started the oil again, but this time HE was putting it on things, himself, to eat--he realized that it was making him better the first time. I think that maybe we didn't give it enough time to work the first time.  For my daughter: After a couple of days of sleeping a ton, being very sick & calling me at work crying because she couldn't stay awake, I took my daughter (13 y.o. then, 17 y.o. now) to the doctor & she was diagnosed with Mono. The doctor explained to me that it is part of the Epstein Barr family (cold sores, herpes, etc.) and that there isn't any kind of medicine that can ""cure"" the illness. He explained that she would sleep a lot, that I needed to call her school & tell them what she had & that she would only be there half days for a few months. I was deflated, stressed & couldn't believe there was nothing I could do for her. I had recently read a book that included coconut oil as a way to detox, lose weight, boost metabolism and so many others and had bought some oil to cook with & take daily. I had done a search & read as much as I could about the coconut & remembered reading that it killed the Epstein Barr virus. I went straight to my computer when I got home & did another search & found the article I had read. I decided to give my daughter the oil twice a day to see if it helped her. I called her down & melted the oil in a spoon & had her take it that afternoon & then again later that evening. The next morning before I left for work I gave her another dose. She called me around lunch time very happy and excited and said she wasn't tired and could stay awake. I remember thinking that the oil was working and was very relieved, but still a bit hesitant. When I got home to my surprise, she was very excited, wide awake & for the first time since she was sick, was chipper and I could tell she was getting back to her old self. I gave her another dose of the oil that evening & for a few days after and she was all better. The oil had killed the virus and restored her health.<br /><br />This stuff is amazing... it cooks food well & is fabulous for your skin.  If you burn in the sun, this will help prevent that as well.  If you are a coconut user this stuff is great... If you're not, this is worth a try.",Awesome Coconut oil & great price!!
"summarize: I know that there are divided camps when it comes to whether or not shipping issues should be part of a product review.  I generally think that shipping is a separate concern, but I'm not so sure after this purchase!  I purchased this product from D.M.E. ONLINE SALES INC (AKA Medical Supply Superstore), but it was shipped by Amazon.  When the package arrived, more than a quarter of it had leaked through both the padded manilla envelope and the box it was shipped in, staining the other item in the box (gloves), as well as the outside of the box that was delivered.  I contacted D.M.E. and they said that it was not their responsability because they didn't handle the shipping.  Which I would agree with, except that there was NOTHING wrong with the packaging; upon closer inspection, the lid of the bottle (beneath the safety seal) hadn't been properly screwed on -something that the company definitely OUGHT to take responsability for!  When I emailed the company to explain this, they never responded. In this case the shipping is very important for the review because losing nearly a third of the product before you get it makes this a VERY expensive product!  Better to buy at the local store for a few dollars more -it will still be cheaper!",What was left of the bottle was fine...
"summarize: Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that ""oven roasted"" + ""honey"" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me.",NOT as good as the ones in the tins
"summarize: I've tried several different kinds of energy drink - and can't stand the taste of most of them.  This one I really like.  It's a bit fruity (mango and pear and apple and peach) and doesn't have the bitter aftertaste of so many others.  It's sweetened with Sucralose, and packs just 20 calories, plus several standard energy ingredients (taurine, ginseng, caffeine, guarana extract, etc.)<br /><br />It's a bit pricey here on Amazon - every vendor I've seen offers it for over two bucks a can when I can find it at my local gas station for about a buck and a half.",Easily my favorite tasting energy drink - but it's worth shopping around for the best price
"summarize: Making your own chai lattes with fine brewed chai tea, cream, spices, sugar, and all that is great, but let's face it you don't want to always have to ""make"" chai lattes to drink them.  Personally, my favorite pre-made chai latte mix has always been Big Train brand, but the downside is that the stuff is hard to find offline and when you can find it, it's very expensive in smaller amounts and I don't drink near enough to justify buying a 4 pound bag of the stuff.  I gave these guys a try just for the heck of it since, hey, I have a Keurig brewer..might as well try one of the hot drink mixes.  I was pleasantly surprised that these kcups were actually better than the Big Train stuff. Unlike a lot of pre-made chai latte mixes, this stuff is just slightly less sweet which allows the tea flavor more room to come out.  It's still sweet and tasty, but it tastes more like a tea drink rather than a sweet, sugary drink that happens to have chai tea in it.  There are a few things for buyers to take note of, though:<br />1. These work best when brewed at 6 or 8 ounces. 10-12 is a bit watery and the spice of the chai loses its emphasis.  It you do brew them at 10-12oz, add some cream to level out the flavor.<br />2. They are very low in sugar compared to most premade mixes (9g in one cup).  This is great for people like me who watch their sugar intake, but the downside is that this is done using sucralose, which some people have digestive issues with.  It would be nice to see alternatives to lowering the sugar that are more natural (stevia blends, isomalts, etc.) but as it stands, I must say I'm glad to see so many drinks for the Keurig brewers that are low-sugar compared to the over-the-top, corn syrup laden mixes you find so often in stores.<br />3. They are a bit pricey, there's no denying it.  However, as it is one of the most popular non-coffee types of K-cup, you can usually find deals if you snoop around enough online.",The best pre-made chai latte I've ever had.
"summarize: We have this Pancake and Waffle mix and we prepare it with Rice milk as my daughter is allergic to dairy AND Soy. It is DELICIOUS. We make Mickey Mouse shaped waffles together, She eats an entire waffle herself. I eat them too because they are SO Delicious and it is easier than making seperate waffle mixes. Plus I think they taste BETTER than regular waffles. Very light and fluffy. We are just finishing our first box (which makes 9 waffles) and I am going to order a case from Amazon because the price is excellent. I paid almost $7 for one box at a local health foods store. I haven't made them into pancakes yet, because we have a waffle iron and it's just simple. Each 1 cup of mix makes 3 waffles. We each eat one and then I put the remaining prepared mix in the fridge and it keeps until the next day or two days later to make another waffle for her. Wonderful product and I can't thank them enough. Check out their website and save the bottom of your boxes. We have Chocolate Cake Mix and frosting to try next!",Delicious- I eat them with my daughter
"summarize: This flavor tastes really good. Not too strong, just right for me. Can't beat the extra vitamins to keep my immunity up to par. The only thing to watch out for is its really red. I mix in a 32 ounce water container, and its really red at 32 ounces. In a smaller water bottle it will really stain your clothes for the day if you have any mis-drinks :) . The good news is it comes out in the wash with ease. I have to say that I am a big time Amazon shopper, but the price is a little high on Amazon. I buy at Walmart much lower price, but that could change if Amazon adjusts their prices...Tastes great though, really enjoy it ! :)","Tastes good, drink with care! :)"
"summarize: The best water for tea is not heavily mineralized, orderless, and crisp. By these metrics, Fiji is by far the best water. And so, I buy Fiji to drink straight. Crisp (vs flat) means to have disolved oxygen - which is more likely if cold and not repeated reboiled. Tap water is not acceptable due to typically being chlorinated and deoxygenated (filtering will likely not help). Some people prefer the taste of highly mineralized water (such as Tucson's tap water). And so, the two best selling brands (Pepsi Aquafina and Coca-Cola Dasani) are just straight from the tap. Coca-Cola even adds salts to help create that perfect tap flavor. But, salts can produce negative interactions with tea. Water for tea should ideally be pH neutral (7). My son feels a neutral pH is most important - but I normally drink tea with lemon juice ... and so a high pH might actually be better for the low pH of lemons. Did a blind test taste with friends and found the one water everyone liked least (always below Tucson's hard tap water) was Costco's Kirkland brand. Moreover, my son (and others) agreed Fugi is the best tasting water. To save money when making tea (I drink more tea than plain water), however, I use Highland Spring.<br /><br />Well recognized waters that tea experts around the globe agree are ideally suited for making exceptional tea include (in order of my preference):<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004T7YQFK"">Highland Spring Non Carbonated Spring Water, 50.7-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a> (United Kingdom)<br />Best deal at half the price of others (pH 7.8)<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013T5YO4"">FIJI Natural Artesian Water, 50-Ounce bottle (Pack of 12)</a> (Fuji) Best tasting (pH 7.5)<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTIPAU"">Crystal Geyser Spring Sport, 33.8-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a> (United States pH 7.9)<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00267A38Y"">Volvic Natural Spring Water, 500ml- Bottles (Pack of 24)</a> (France pH 7.0)<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ANW7HQ"">Nutriteam Countertop Water Distiller Stainless, Glass Collection</a><br />Don't use water immediately to allow for disolving of oxygen",Best taste but a bit expensive
"summarize: I love Newman's Own's prunes.  They're organic, which is important especially if you like to eat large quantities of prunes or habitually over a long period of time.<br /><br />In addition, these prunes are *consistently moist*.  Not in the ""so moist, they're mushy and they've broken apart in the bag, so it feels like I am trying to eat very sweet mushpoo"" -- no, these prunes are all intact, beautifully pruney wholes that are simply moist.

"summarize: I ordered this product thinking it would be similar to the rock sugar I was using all over Germany this past winter.  They also sell it at Teavana but at an extremely high price compared to what I brought back from Germany (obviously there is a big expense on bringing sugar to the US).  I was excited to find these online and the picture looked like what I had brough back from Germany.  I'm not sure it was the same thing.  The crystals weren't the same color as the German rock sugar, it was cloudy in color and was more like pebbles vs. rocks.  The order took an entire 2 or 3 weeks to actually process and ship, come to find out, the place it shipped from was in my state.  I thought it was completely ridiculous how long it took and when it arrived it was poorly packaged.  It came in a white box (similar to a shirt box but a bit smaller) and the rocks were all falling out of it and pressed up against the box (between the it and the worn and dirty looking plastic wrapping that enclosed the box).  When I opened the plastic liner, the box was so flimpsy the sugar was going all over my counter despite how careful I was seeing how damaged the box was.  Never again.",Not at all what I expected
"summarize: This review is based on my experience with the shipper British Delights. I ordered these Jaffa Cakes on the 25 and received them on the 28th. I only ordered one because I was not sure how the quality would compare to my previous experience of having these gems on my last trip to England. The package I received were fresh cakes and was sent very securely using UPS. It's hard to write a review about Jaffa Cakes because you either love them or hate them but if you want to give them a shot I would give them a try. I already fell in love with this item and was excited to see it available on Amazon but I was mostly afraid of the quality of the item as Amazon does not ship this themselves and I am somewhat scared to use other sellers so I gave British Delights a try because they offered the lower price compared to the others available and they had good reviews. I have not tried the other sellers so I can not speak for the quality of the item and at the moment I will stick with British Delights as I just ordered 4 more boxes to stock up.<br /><br />Just a little advice, Jaffa Cakes are a nice treat and snack to have every now and then but I really think they will be best enjoyed with tea or something light to drink with. Don't take this as if it is a dry cake because it is not but it just adds to the experience. You don't eat these like other snack foods... thou you could. I included some pictures of the box I received with health information and just how the box looks really. Today is September 28 2012 and the best by date on the box I received was November 17 2012",Its nice to see these again
"summarize: A couple of years ago, my friends showed us the Flavia machine and then gave me a taste of how good a cup of coffee it could make. We immediately went out and bought one and have enjoyed using it ever since. While I have tried all of their different blends, we have settled on the House Blend as our daily brew. My wife can only drink de-caf and I find that the difference in taste between regular and the ""un-leaded"" is beyond my meager taste buds ability to tell the difference.  Especially since I usually put in sweetener and milk.<br /><br />The taste is smooth but with a good body. The blend has a good just-brewed coffee aroma but can be sharp and intense if you stand close by the machine as it steams out a cup. I have not tried to drink it black but I have sipped it with just half & half and it's quite nice.<br /><br />If you have a Flavia machine and want to cut down on the caffeine you drink, you will be pleased with the decaf house blend.<br /><br />4 and not 5 stars because I don't love the sharp aroma at brew time.","Smooth taste, without the jitters - for Flavia owners only"
"summarize: I love green tea, have been pleased with many of the Bigelow Tea flavors.  My favorite, by far, is the Green Tea with Peach.  It is not overpowering peach flavor, but you can definitely taste it and smell the delicate aroma.  It pairs excellently with green tea and I religiously drink it EVERY morning when I wake up.  I do not find a need to sweeten it, although if I make iced tea with it, I will sometimes add a touch of light agave nectar for a little change.  One tea bag, properly steeped, is a highlight of my morning and because of the individual tea bags (which are packaged so as not to get torn or damaged by the elements) come with me in my bag and I drink it at work and throughout the day.  I drink this tea so much that I have been subscribed to receive my Bigelow Green Tea with Peach, by the case (yes, the pack of 6 20-ct boxes) every few months.  It's inexpensive, much more economical (due to my level of consumption) than anywhere else I might try to purchase it.<br /><br />I definitely recommend to anyone who loves a nice aroma and pleasant tasting green tea.","Drink Everyday, by it by the Case!"
"summarize: I'm fairly sure I don't like it. But I literally can't stop drinking it. I take a sip and my brain says ""Hey, you don't really like that flavor much. OH! Dude! Drink some more though.""<br /><br />I don't get it. But I'm addicted. I decided to give some to my wife without telling her my reaction. Immediately she wrinkled her nose and said ""Eww, I don't like that."" Then about 30 seconds later she asked for another sip. Then another. That's when I told her my reaction. She agrees. Some kind of voodoo magic is at work here. Or, we both like it but refuse to accept that fact. Not sure. I'm betting on voodoo magic.",I don't know why I drink it
"summarize: I LOVE morels.  I fondly remember picking them when I was younger, and frying them for morel sandwiches.  Unfortunately, I no longer live in an area where they grow. So when I saw this, I decided to try it.<br /><br />I was pretty disappointed in the product.  I give it 3 stars because it is what it says it is...morel mushroom powder and bits in Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  Unfortunately, you cannot taste much 'morel' flavor over the taste of the EVOO, and the EVOO itself is a bit on the bitter side (in other words, not the best EVOO).<br /><br />I will use the six jars I purchased (3 meat, 3 salad), but I doubt I would order them again.",I wanted these to be better
"summarize: I've seen Peace cereals at the store for some time, but was hesitant to buy it because it was expensive (~$4.50). I finally tried it, and it was a great choice! A great taste unlike any other organic cereal I've tried - unique with the cardamom and other spices. It has a nice bite to it, a nice spice about it, and the mango flavor is good too. I'm not as fond of corn flakes as I am of wheat flakes, but these corn flakes are crisp and crunchy. I really like the oat clusters. I also tried the Raspberry Ginger Peace cereal and it was just as good and unique.<br /><br />Only two downsides (which is why I rate this a 4) -<br />1. not many servings - it says 7 servings, but I usually just get 4 (and I measure)<br />2. high sodium for cereal - why does cereal need that much sodium? Most of the cereals I buy have no sodium.<br />3. Ok so there is a 3rd reason - the price.",Great taste unlike any other cereal!
"summarize: I'm about 6 months in to my transition to becomming vegan.  Every once in a while I think of something that I ""miss"".  All week I was craving Mac and Cheese but since I stopped eating the meat and dairy, my body has stopped knowing how to process those foods.  Soooo, I couldn't ""cheat"" and eat Mac and Cheese.  I was in the Gluten Free aisle at Central Market searching for pastas when I stumbled upon this.  I took it home and after about 25 minutes of my husband picking on me, I tried it out.  Ooooh Eeeeem Gheeee was it incredible!<br />I even stuffed some in my husband's mouth...he promptly requested more - to which I replied, Absolutely not :)<br />I had to come on Amazon and buy a whole set so going forward I am never without :)<br />Seriously, the best Mac and Cheese I've ever had!",Should have a 6 Star Option
"summarize: I bought a 12 pack of the Tuna on Rice with Prawns after reading reviews here on Amazon. If you're still on the fence about trying Tiki brand - do it!<br /><br />The graphic design on the labeling and the whole ""Tiki"" thing seemed contrived and cliche to me - ""Oh, just one more boutique cat food company selling crap out of a pretty can.""

"summarize: I agree....it works with ANYTHING!  Great on turkey burgers...really zips up an otherwise boring non flavor.  Use on any meat, veggies for grilling, soups and stews; add to meatball mix and make wonderful dips and spreads.  Try mixing Feta cheese, bit of mayo, little bit of Greek Salad dressing (I use Yassou, but I think that one's local to Boston) and Cavender's.  Whip to incorporate all ingredients into a smooth thick dip.  Use with veggies, crackers or my favorite, on grilled turkey burgers.  If you want to use the dip with lamb, add lemon juice and fresh or dried mint.  Yummy!  There is just so much you can do with it!  I too buy it in the five pound tub.  If the ship were sinking, the Cavender's goes with me!","Impossible to be a ""great"" cook without Cavender's"
"summarize: I've bought this pumpkin before but cannot find canned pumpkin in the grocery store during non-holiday periods, for some reason.  Although the consistency is not as nice as Libby's pumpkin - this is a little watery, the fact that it's organic scores big points.  I mix it with my dog and cats foods, so the wateryness is not an issue.  My complaint is that it was not well packed for shipping.  Almost half the cans were damaged to a point that I would not have purchased them in the grocery store.  The contents seem to be fine, but I will try to find some other source next time, as the shipping seems to be a consistent issue in other reviews I have read for this product.","Product is Fine, Shipping is Iffy"
"summarize: I am really picky about my shampoos/conditioners, and was SO dubious when Amazon sent me this item to review.<br />I have colored, fine hair, which frizzes easily and breaks often.  It grows very slowly and any harsh shampoos/conditioners will either break my hair or weigh it down and make it look dirty and lifeless.<br /><br />Amazon sent me this item (Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Damage and Color Repair Nourishing Shampoo) and the corresponding shampoo (Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Damage and Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner).<br /><br />I usually use the Nexxus damaged hair products that are found at Costco.  It is expensive, even at Costco.  But it didn't weigh my hair down nor cause breakage.<br /><br />This shampoo and conditioner smells GREAT.  I usually don't notice the scents, unless they are gross or medicinal, because my sense of smell is limited.  But this one smells really great, like fruity flowers.<br /><br />I use it basically like everyone--shampoo, rinse, condition, let sit for a minute and rinse.<br /><br />Here is where it's different:  When I comb out my hair, which is longer than shoulder length, it doesn't pull, tangle, or (on the other end of the spectrum) feel greasy or heavy.  It combs out sleekly (is that a word?) and as my hair dries naturally, it's not frizzy or lifeless--it shows off my natural curls.  If I dry it with the blowdryer, it doesn't frizz at all.  I can flat iron it, and maybe because it really allows the hair to curl naturally, it takes a bit more work to get that curl out, but it looks GREAT.<br /><br />I have been using it for a month now, and my hair dresser actually noticed a difference in my hair. She said that it grew more than usual (she's been doing my hair for 3 years now, every 6 weeks).  I believe that because my hair doesn't break or frizz, my hair really is ""growing"" faster because it's not breaking off.<br /><br />I didn't think that any line could replace my Nexxus, but this has.  It took me a long time to find the Nexxus--with my sensitive hair that breaks so easily...  And it saves me money, too, which is a great thing, especially in this economy.","Move over Nexxus, this is just as good, if not better"
"summarize: Please note that this review concerns the ""Peanut Butter Oreo Fudge Cremes"" that come in a blue package, not the yellow package as pictured.<br /><br />That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by this ""confection.""  It doesn't have the dry, hard chocolate cookie of the original Oreo.  Instead, it can be described as a dark chocolate candy outer layer, but with a very slight, pleasing crunch.  Inside is a thin layer of peanut butter.  The closest comparison is to Reese's peanut butter cup.  But I find this to be a higher quality of chocolate than Reese's (Yes, I'm a dark chocolate lover) It's also much smaller and thinner than Reese's, and, to my taste, less sweet. On the other hand, one cookie should satisfy anyone's sweet tooth, at a calorie count of less than 60 calories -- if one is to believe the nutrition facts.  Perfect for that ""I want a little something just to tide me over.""",Taste and size make for a nice afternoon snack
"summarize: I recently discovered buying coffee on Amazon and have fallen in love with the convenience.  I decided to try this based on the rave reviews.  Wish I wouldn't have listened.  Not nearly as good as I expected.  Note that it doesn't taste bad, it's just that it doesn't have much taste at all.<br /><br />Also disappointed in the packaging.  The companies seal on the coffee is a joke and the coffee was all over my Amazon box when it showed up.  This could be another reason the coffee did not taste very fresh since it was not air tight.  Will continue to search other coffees on Amazon.",Not as good as reviews say
summarize: Good tasting product - but doesn't seem to be whole grain rice.  This rice simply seems brown - but does not have any fibre (0 g of fibre on the nutrient composition label). This is no fault of the company as they do not advertise it as whole grain rice - but when you read other reviews you think it may be.  I really wish Amazon would post the nutrient profile of the food items they sell like many grocery stores do so you know what it is before the item arrives. Lundberg has a variety of whole grain rices for a similar price and are really tasty (although they take longer to cook because they are whole grain) they have about 3 g of fibre per serving according to the nutrition label.,Is this a whole grain rice?
"summarize: Review:<br />I've eaten ramen for a long time (30+ years) and have eaten numerous varieties and the Shin ramen is probably my #1 tasting. The reasons are as follows:<br />* Best flavor broth - it's spicy (but adjustable), leaves a good aftertaste (yes, even when you burp), tint of mushroom flavor coupled with a good balance of red pepper, onions and spices.<br />* Noodles have good texture - depending how you cook them of course but with bad ones, no matter how you cook them they come out soggy/soft. These come out chewy if you want or softer if you overcook them.<br />* It's not oily - I've noticed with some noodles, you can see a ring of oil around the pot after you cook the noodles. So with these I sometimes had to boil an extra pot of water and then transfer the cooked noodles to the fresh pot of water to get rid of the oil. Not with Shin Ramen.<br />* Economical - for less than a dollar a pack, they beat any dollar menu item<br />* Great for any weather - particularly winter to keep you warm. In the summer, they help to break out a sweat and opens your pores<br />* Can be a hearty meal - you can add all types of things to this ramen as others have posted. An egg is recommended but so are vegetables and meat.<br /><br />Tips:<br /><br />Amount of water - add about 2 mug size cup fulls of water. If not sure, add a little less. You can always add more after it's fully cooked. Adding cold water at the end cools down the boiling hot soup so it's easier to eat.<br /><br />How to cook - wait til the water boils. As soon as it does, drop in everything: the soup base, noodles, dried vegie packet. If you want to add vegies, let it cook for about a minute before adding e.g. mushrooms, bean sprouts, tomatoes, green onions. Don't put more than a quarter couple of any vegies or meat cuz you'll kill the flavor. For eggs, if you like them well cooked, add them at the beginning. You can add at the end of cooking too but this is a bit too raw for my taste<br /><br />Cooking time - boil the noodles 2 - 4 minutes. This depends on how hard or soft you like your noodles. Just pull a strand out and taste it every 30 seconds after the first minute. There's no right or wrong here.<br /><br />Soup base - add all of it. Don't worry about it being too spicy. Per above you can always water it down later. The soup will be plenty hot. Remember it just finished boiling and it's difficult to put something in your mouth when it was just boiling.<br /><br />How to serve - there are 3 ways I'd recommend<br />1) The traditional Korean way - folks like to eat straight from the pot. There's actually an 'art' to this. After removing it from the stove, place the pot on something that wont burn. Grab the lid of the pot, a spoon (yes a spoon) and chop sticks (fork if you can't wield them).<br /><br />2) In a bowl. Don't use a plastic one unless it can stand the heat. I don't like to use plastic period for health reasons but up to you. Remove some of the excess soup from the pot first and then pour everything directly into the bowl. Grab a spoon and chopsticks/fork and place the bowl down and go to work.<br /><br />3) combination of 1 and 2 above. Place the pot of ramen and get a bowl along with a spoon and chopsticks/fork.<br /><br />How to eat:<br />First, forget what your parents have told you on slurping. To eat ramen, you must slurp. Why? Because 1) if you don't you'll burn your lips because no slurping means the noodles must pass through your lips slower and enclosed more around the noodles. 2) because your lips are more enclosed, most of the soup around the noodles are sucked away from noodles, leaving you with less flavorful noodles. So forget the decorum. Eat it asian style and slurp away.<br /><br />2nd, I'd recommend the Korean way (#1 above). You grab the pot lid then take about 2 mouthful amounts of noodle and dump it into the lid. You should be holding the lid with your left hand (switch if you're right handed) and quickly grab a large spoon and add several spoonfuls of soup broth into the lid. You're doing 3 things here 1) you're saturating the noodles with the flavorful broth. 2) by adding the noodles to the lid, you're cooling it down for consumption while keeping the rest of the noodles hot. 3) When you eat straight from the lid, you first eat the noodles and immediately follow up with a slurp from the lid itself to drink the soup base. To do this, you put the lid close to your mouth and then push the noodles in with your utensil, drink the soup right after or together as you push the noodles in. I know this sounds crude but the flavor is maximized this way. You can add any vegetables or meat to eat bite this way too.<br /><br />If you want to eat using method #2, well, it needs no explanation, just make sure you slurp and drink the broth as you eat the noodles.<br /><br />For method #3, you're basically substituting the bowl for the lid. Works as well but assuming your lid is metal, it keeps the noodles hotter. Also, people tend to put more noodles into a bowl then a lid and this ends up cooling the noodle down too much. It's also slower cuz you dont hold the bowl in your hand where as with the lid, since you're holding it, you grab noodles, place them briefly on the lid then straight to your mouth. It's cooler too ;>)<br /><br />Third, some people like to make this a heartier meal by adding rice. I usually don't add the rice to the pot until I'm half-way through because it's too hot and because the meal loses its flavor and it's too heavy. However, by adding rice directly to the pot full of ramen, you have more of a hearty meal.<br /><br />Now, enjoy!",Ramen connoiseur's review & tips on the Shin Ramen
"summarize: I am usually not overly impressed with these samplers of specialty cheeses, but I do run a cross one now and again that simply stand out.  This is one of them.  I fully admit to being almost addicted to good cheddar so perhaps this is part of it.  The quality of this cheese, even after being shipped all over the place and from heaven knows where, is absolutely excellent.  My sweet friend Brenda sent me this one and it is going to take some hard work to figure out how to top her on this one.  Secret for you:  I plan to purchase one or two of these myself soon horde it away, and simply not share!  I do recommend you give this sampler a try...you will be absolutely delighted.",One of the best I have received
"summarize: If you're not able to make your own and freeze it, this is certainly the next best thing.  It is very expensive for not a lot of food, especially considering if you were making your own it would cost you one tenth of what they are charging.<br />This comes in a styrofoam container.  So if you were ordering this on a regular basis you would be the proud owner of many styrofoam cooler containers... I'm not sure what to do with the one.  I know it comes frozen but it seems like there must be something out there other than styrofoam, honestly shouldn't the stuff be banned already?  My older two kids and I had a great time with the dry ice however.<br /><br />The baby does like the food so far.  Frozen instead of jars is an interesting idea, although I think I will freeze my own and continue to use my processor to process what we are eating for her and keep jars for emergencies.",Too expensive and too much packaging
"summarize: I am so happy with this!  I got this as a present to give to a coworker. It is really good quality for the price. I wanted to get something that wasn't too expensive but would make a nice ""happy birthday"" present. This coffee masters around the world pack was perfect!  It looks just as pictured and it smells amazing. I was tempted to open it up myself, but I have resisted. I actually got this 1 day before the person's birthday. I ordered via Amazon Prime. It came on time! If it had come early, I am sure I would have opened this for myself.<br /><br />The packaging looks really nice. It seems like it would be more than $12. I think that in a retail store, it would probably cost like $20.  The idea of having a sampler is great for coffee lovers. I am happy very much with the presentation and agree with others who say this is a high quality looking item.",Just got this in the mail
"summarize: Hershey's Sugar Free Dark Chocolate candy bars tastes very close to the full sugar version. Dark Chocolate was always one of my favorite treats before coming a Type 2 diabetic, so it is great being able to have it again in a sugar free version. There is a little bit of an after taste with these but dark chocolate is usually bitter so it isn't really an issue for me (but my wife says she notices more than I do).<br /><br />I should mention that eating too many of these (more than 3 or 4) does cause me some ""gastric distress"", so you might want to try them at home before eating a bunch while out in public.<br /><br />Recommended","Very Close to the ""Real"" Thing - Recommended"
"summarize: I like the Newman's Special Blend, and would give it a 4.5 on the 1 to 5 star review range.  It is a little bitter as most stronger coffees are, but not too too bitter.  I would say it leans towards strong on the medium to strong scale, but it's not overwhelming.  If you like a nice normal blend with some kick, and are an advocate of organic initiatives, this is a great pick.<br /><br />I also like to say that I always look to buy the good Newman's Own brands when I can based on the fact that the Newman's Own Foundation continues Paul Newman's commitment to donate all profits to charity.  A fantastic American non-profit company.  You are not forgotten Mr. Paul Newman - RIP.",Real good cup of medium to bold coffee
"summarize: I am a huge fan of Community Coffee.  The company often runs specials, they are very responsive to their customers and their product is good.<br /><br />I've tried most of their flavors now and this one is a very good one.  I buy this any time i find it on sale.<br /><br />I've written the company asking for samplers and they sent all kinds.  It was great.  I also love their decaf and 1/2 caf products too.<br /><br />They will email you when there are large storms (like the hurricanes) to let you know there may be a delay in shipping.  Makes sense.<br /><br />I believe all the beans are roasted here in the US.<br /><br />Huge fan of Community Coffee.<br /><br />But, I also realize that not everyone will agree.  What i like, you may not and vice verse.<br /><br />My recommendation... buy 1 bag (it's now sold in local stores where i live) and if you like it, then come back to Amazon for more as the prices here are often the best, unless the company is running a special.",Private Reserve House Blend... good coffee
"summarize: I love this product, it cooks in 2 minutes and good for you. I only cook what I can eat in one day, left overs are not good for you. I get the 4 pack and I keep the one I am using in a canning jar with lid on, the rest go into the refrigerator till I need them.  That way they are at their peak of freshness.  I hope to have time to grind it up in my BlendTec blender into flour and mix some in with white whole wheat flour and make some no-knead bread.

"summarize: I am a coffee lover and usually enjoy a strong cappuccino in the morning.  I tried this coffee and was impressed by the aroma and flavor.  It is not too strong but has a good not-too bitter flavor.  I really like the pods - so much less mess but these are all individually wrapped!  I know a lot of coffee pods/packets are to keep in the freshness but maybe organic and fair-trade coffee manufacturers could care a little more about the waste produced from individually wrapped items.  Needless to say, I did enjoy my cup of coffee and would buy this product again.",Good earth-friendly coffee but too much packaging
"summarize: I ordered the Indus Organic ground Ceylon Cinnamon because a knowledgeable friend informed me that the Cinnamon we Americans use is actually not true cinnamon, but Cassia, a cousin of Cinnamon that has VERY different chemical properties.  When I found out that the blood-thinning potential of Cassia is over one thousand times as potent as true Ceylon Cinnamon, I was determined to sample the Ceylon Cinnamon and see how I liked it.  I have always found Cassia very bitter and overbearing, so I was hopin Ceylon Cinnamon would be a milder version of Cassia taste-wise.  I must say I was surprised by the taste...it does have a hint of what my palette is used to in the ""cinnamon"" arena, but there is also a scent of bay laurel or something else rather herbal about it.  It is not unpleasant, but it doesn't taste like Cassia!  I am enjoying it on its own merits.  I like to sprinkle a good amount in an empty mug and add hot water and a little milk for a lovely nigthttime beverage!",Subtle and spicy ground Ceylon Cinnamon
"summarize: I sure wish this was sold in the USA, but I haven't found it yet.  It's a delicious candy, but unfortunately my candy was discolored and old.  I never heard back about trying to get a refund or exchange, so I guess I'm out of luck.  I did order it during the month of June, but it's typically not that hot in June here, so I thought I was safe to order it then.  I doubt that I'll order from this vendor again since I never heard back from them.  I suppose ordering during Winter would be the way to go, but the climate in CA is never predictable, so it's a difficult thing to predict when it might be safe to order/ship.  From the looks of the discolored chocolate and the partially good and partially bad inner part of the candy, I am not sure what happened ... only that I'm out the money, and I had to throw away a lot of the product.  The low rating is due to the poor condition the candy arrived in (stale insides, discolored chocolate) and due to the poor customer service (or perhaps I should say NO customer service).  Otherwise, IF in good condition, this candy rates a 5.  Buy it somewhere else that will give you support and definitely buy cooler times of the year (as another reviewer wrote).  I was so disheartened by the lack of support that I forgot to write a review.  Sorry if my tardiness caused another buyer to suffer the same fate as I.",Great Candy Usually But Not From this Seller
"summarize: After initially being somewhat disappointed with this product I figured out what was different than my own home made dough. All it was in need of was a little oil added to it. So, now when I make the dough, I usually add about 1 1/2 tablespoons of vegetable oil to the mixture and then proceed as directed. Now I am a happy cook with this product and can recommend it for purchase. Otherwise, it did taste more like a yeasty flour cake mix type product.

"summarize: There's no much to say - If you want to taste the best Tequila Mexico has ever produced, buy this bottle.<br /><br />If you think you have tasted Tequila because you tried one like ""Tequila Jose Cuervo Especial"", let me start by telling you that's simply the worst Tequila flavor I have ever tasted.

"summarize: After years of drink the same old Folgers drip coffee a group of us decided to purchase a Keurig unit for our office.  When any one of us purchase a pack of K-Cups we often share with other so that we can find our favorite, and not spend on those that just are not up to par.  I enjoyed the flavor of the Italian roast, and the people that I shared it with said they did too.  So far, out of the ten or so K-Cup ""flavors"" that I have tried this is my favorite.  Being that it is a ""bold"" coffee - I can change the cup volume setting of my Keurig unit to alter the boldness...a larger setting yields a slightly less bold cup, and the smaller cup setting will increase the boldness of the taste.  Of course you can do this with any coffee, this coffee seems to fit the boldness range that i desire.",Italian roast - just how i like it

Once I experienced it, I drove back the very next morning and bought the remaining inventory they had to enjoy and share with friends. Several months later after running out, I went to the company's website in Aspen Colorado and ordered some more.<br /><br />When I ran out again, they were kind enough to inform me that I could order it from Amazon and that it would qualify for Amazon's awesome free shipping.

This has become my go-to bag when I need a quick cup of tea. The scent of this tea is utterly amazing- strong cinnamon, but not overwhelming. I could sniff the packet all day.

"summarize: ""Nong Shim Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowl"" was another Amazon Vine sample that one of the kids snatched up and ate before I could properly review it.  So you'll have to be happy with this second-hand report.  Anyway, my daughter was the one who grabbed this particular product up (as opposed to my son, who nabbed the ""Chips Ahoy!"" cookies).  Not a girl of many words (at least not with the parents, generally) she said that she microwaved it, and that it was delicious.

"summarize: I just purchased the regular Via for Iced Coffee today at my local Starbuck's (they ran a free tall beverage of choice offer today, which encouraged my indulgence; The gal was kind enough to upgrade my tall to a grande and give me an extra Via packet gratis!).<br /><br />I was a little disheartened to learn that they don't offer an unsweetened version (just this regular and limited edition caramel flavor), but opted to take the plunge anyway. As someone who typically drinks iced coffees and iced teas without sugar, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the taste of Via is not at all on ""sugar overload"". The powder mixed and dissolved quickly and the product tastes just as if you had purchased it from your local Starbuck's barista at a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />Would I purchase it again?

"summarize: These make my morning latte so easy! I have only had my DeLonghi for a couple of months and I am no expert (at all, I mean it's just plain sad) with trying to get ground coffee tamped correctly to make a good cup of espresso. ESE pods for me are perfect - easy to put in, easy to take out, no mess, and no skill required. These Lavazza pods are admittedly not quite as good as Illy, but if you buy in the bulk box these are about 30 cents per unit. In contrast, Illy costs about $13 for a box of 18 pods... just too pricey for everyday drinking! And actually, I think that the Lavazza pods produce a better crema.<br /><br />Also, I feel inclined to mention that not only did I receive my pods with lots of shelf-life left (over a year), but all that I have used so far have been correctly tamped and produce a good, strong espresso.<br /><br />**Update 6 months later...

"summarize: Cats are naturally picky eaters from what I've read. Although I haven't had my cat for long at the time of purchase(two weeks), I was afraid of going and making this purchase because if he doesn't eat it, it would be a waste of $35. He's already turned his nose away from what his previous owner left with me. And I'd switched several brands already. And they were wet foods too.<br /><br />Thankfully, my fears never came true. It turns out, he loves Wellness CORE. Recently, he got UTI and was placed on medication. I was told to keep him on a wet diet for now until his UTI went away. I placed the liquid medication in his wet food and mixed it very well because I wasn't about to scruff him to force feed him medicine. But he took two bites of the wet food and turned his nose at it.

"summarize: When I first bought Nestle (Nescafe) Mountain Blend Coffee, (with the extra smooth taste), several years ago, I thought that the ""blend"" in the name referred to several different types of mountain-grown coffee.  Silly me!  The ""blend"" herein is instant coffee mixed with another, NON-COFFEE ingrediewnt!  It's been several years since I bought this coffee, and I'm not near a supermarket, so I can't give you the name of the other ingredient....but I do remember it started with an ""M"". It's an OK additive for instant coffee, I guess....but when a customer, (at least, THIS customer), comes across a coffee which calls itself ""Mountain-Blend Coffee"", with an ""extra-smooth taste"", one would expect the ""extra smooth taste"" to come from the COFFEE BLEND.  But no such ""blend of coffees"" here.  Nope.  Just coffee, (I suspect only one type), and the for-now mysterious ""M"" ingredient, (you cn read it, in small letters, on the label of every jar of this coffee....in the supermarket, that is.  (There is, as of this date, NO mention of this extra ingredient here on Amazon.)<br /><br />Of course, it's possible that NOW, there really IS a blend of several different coffees in this ""Mountain Blend Coffee.""  It's been several years since I was SO disappointed, that I haven't spent the time or energy looking for this particular instant coffee in the supermarket for at least fuur years.  However, the ingredients are NOT listed here on Amazon, (be they several types of coffee OR just the one coffee with the non-coffee ""smoothing"" ingredien), so one does not know.  However, the label STILL proclaims how ""smooth"" this coffee is, so I suspect it's the same one I hurriedly bought without looking at he label, several years ago.  My advice:  Look At The Label.  Of thi coffee....of every coffee, and of everything else you buy, in the supermarkt or out of it.<br /><br />Nestles makes the excellent ""Taster's Choice"" Coffee line.

"summarize: If I had to choose between the Original Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, and this new Vegi Original, I would have to stick with the good old Original Blue Box.  The veggie version of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese tastes pretty much the same, includes a few minor additions to nutrition, including 15% Vitamin C, an additional 5% in iron, and 2g more dietary fiber...but is this worth the missing 2 oz of cheesy goodness and the higher price tag?  Not really, in my opinion.  When reading the ingredients, it seems like the big addition is cauliflower (which is actually fairly low in the ingredients list).<br /><br />If you're really itching to add more veggie in your kid's diet without them knowing, this is an okay start.  Otherwise, it's not really a significant enough difference to adding veggies in your kids' diet.

"summarize: Well, it just came yesterday, 100 tea bags of Windsor, supposed to be the best. I made a pitcher of 20 tea bags by boiling the water, boiling again, letting it sit, putting a tea bag in my mouth and sucking and see if it would numb it. No not noticible at all, no wonder its legal in the US, stupid Coca tea! I heard if you put 3 in your mouth and suck on it for a while it will get numb, but I don't feel like doing that. I'm on my 3rd cup of iced tea today and I think I'm gonna just get a sugar-free monstor or drink expresso. Do I feel stimulated? Slightly. Do I feel sober? Yes. Alert? Yes. Energetic? Not particularly, and the fact its 65 degrees in the house doesn't help, I like warmth. Is it real Coca leaves? Yes, but dried and apparently from my research it would take 100 bags to equal 1 gram of coke. Does that mean 100 bags of fresh? I dont know. Why is it legal? Because there are not enough alkaloids in the tea to be considered an illegal substance, kinda like poppy seeds or the essence of coca you will see in the ingredients of coca-cola. It's also known to calm the cravings of cocaine users, although I don't have cravings any way, but if you do it's recommended.<br /><br />I'm now brewing one cup with 3 bags and seeing if I can tell anything...I pour the boiling water on the 3 bags. It has a nice green grassy color, similiar to green tea. It's quite delicious and as I drink it down my mood is slightly lifted, heart beat increases, but no more than with caffeine. Is it like cocaine? No, not at all and if you buy the tea hoping it's going to be that way, you've got another thing coming and will be very disappointed. I knew all this before I decided to try this. I'm not disappointed, yet not entirely enthusiastic about it either.<br /><br />It's a good alternative for thoughs who don't like coffee, it has a vast amount of vitamins, minerals and health benefits and is certainly better for you than caffeine. Also, surprisingly, no jitters like with coffee. Is it like doing a drug? No, not at all, I feel completely sober, yet my spirits are lifted a bit and a slight tingle, but it could be b/c I'm trying to feel something. I can see why it would be legal in the U.S not to mention it helps the trade commission in a safe legal way. And I'm not just saying that to keep it legal, everything I read about it not being anything like a drug has been true. I just didn't know until I tried it.<br /><br />After drinking the entire pitcher I was very giddy, but that was probably just the mood I was in naturally.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Probably not, it's rather expensive. I'll just drink my cuban expresso, I like caffeine better than coca tea.",Windsor Coca Tea Not So Great

"summarize: I have been using this fertilizer for years on the recommended plants.  But this year I decided to try it on some other plants that typically you would not use this on.<br />I live in an area that gets lots of freezes and frosts and some occasional snow, though not heavy.  I also am a devoted lover of geraniums and I like to have them growing in hanging pots. But they will not withstand the winters here, so I winter them over in the greenhouse and bring them out when they are safe from frost. When they come out they always have suffered dieback of some of the branches, sometimes a lot depending on the winter.  So, this year, I decided to try giving them the miracle grow for acid loving plants instead of general purpose miracle grow.  It made a huge difference.  I fed them this several times until the foliage came back, and boy did it come back.  They are much more lush and green and as a result have more branches to produce buds.  After which I switched back to general purpose miracle grow.  I decided to try the same procedure on other plants not previously treated this way, such as roses and it produced the same results.  Then of course I switched back to regular rose food.  I even tried it on my tomatoes right after transplanting them from the greenhouse to the ground.  It gave them a boost during the transition from greenhouse to outdoors, without trying to get them to produce blooms.  It has been a boon to my tomatoes.  They made the transition seamlessly.",good for more than you think
"summarize: I often get a sour stomach from drinking coffee, so I thought I'd give Puroast a try.<br /><br />Just as methods of decaffeination often affect the taste of coffee, so does whatever technique they used to reduce the acidity.<br /><br />It's a shame, because the fresh grounds had a wonderful aroma, but the brewed coffee had a bitterness beyond what I normally associated with acidity. As a result, the flavor didn't have much dimension.<br /><br />On the plus side, there were no negative stomach effects, so I suppose if I wanted the caffeine and wanted to avoid the possibility of a sour stomach, this would be a reasonable alternative. That's an unlikely scenario, though.","Has potential, but really doesn't taste that good."
"summarize: I just found out two years ago that I have celiac disease and must eat gluten free. I live in a small town that is 3 hours from a big town, and there are not a lot of gluten free options available here. I thought I was just not going to be able to enjoy pizza anymore. Then I ate at a Picazzo's restaurant. They offer a gluten free pizza that is delicious, so I knew it could be done. I decided to look around on Amazon and found these pizza shells. The reviews were pretty good, so I ordered some. At the time, they were on sale and I got them for about $30. You have to buy 5 packs at a time (a total of 10 shells) from Amazon. I have made 4 pizzas using the shells, and I am now wondering if I should throw the rest away or give them to the food bank. First off, when you cut open the plastic bag the shells are packed in, you find that they smell very bad. I checked the ingredients to try and identify the odor. The shells contain pear juice. If you opened a can of pears, poured them out, and left the empty, unwashed can out in the sun for a day, you might match the smell, so maybe it comes from the pear juice. The smell is not as strong once the shells are cooked, but it is still there and an unpleasant taste goes with it. My bottom line recommendation is that,  if you really want to try these shells, you buy one package somewhere else to try before you spring for 5 packages from Amazon. To answer my own question, are these better than no pizza at all? I would say no, they are not.",Better than no pizza at all?
"summarize: Years ago I always made all the baby food my kids ate to ensure they only had high quality, fresh food with no additives and no preservatives.  I was very curious about this new squeeze dispense baby food, and rather skeptical as well.  The ingredients are nice & simple : Organic Pears, Organic broccoli, Organic Spinach, Ascorbic Acid & Organic Lemon Juice.  I like it so far<br />Next the taste test was not as sweet as I expected considering pears was listed first.  This is great because I don't want baby to develop a sweet tooth this early.  The flavor tends more towards the spinach than the broccoli.<br />I'm not a fan of this packaging.  The cap can easily be a choking hazard and it seems as though this pouch could easily be redesigned without it, it serves no meaningful purpose to me.  A tear strip would be much safer.<br />I tried this and like it, my nephew willingly ate it, but I don't think he was a huge fan.  Overall I like this product and would probably purchase this for travel convenience.  Amazon's price especially with the available coupons make this a very economical healthy choice.",Delicious & Nutritious / Easy to Use Great when travelling
"summarize: These are one of the best multi-grain or whole wheat pita chip snacks I've tried.  They are very hearty... hold up well to hummus... and would probably taste just as good with some peanut butter, good old onion dip, chili or other heavy dips.  What I like most, however... is that these are so easy to get on Amazon!!<br /><br />We live in an area that is not known for thinking outside of the bag o chips, so to speak... so when we travel and go into grocery stores, I always look for a brand of whole wheat or grain pita chips to try... and then if they are good, I will see if I can get them on line. These, I found at Publix in FL...I'd researched getting these directly from the company... and after shipping, they were more expensive (though  this might have changed since I looked last).  This qualifies for FREE shipping with Amazon!<br /><br />From Amazon, they arrived when expected... and the box was in perfect shape... no mushed up bags inside!!  The expiration on the bag is in MARCH 09 and at this rate,  I will be ordering by the end of Dec... and I got these mid Nov, I think...so no fear in these getting stale.  My family loves them, too!<br /><br />Will definitely order these wonderful tasting chips again and definitely from Amazon!!",Just awesome.... totally happy...and convenient to get!
"summarize: Beware of this product--I always shop on Amazon and figured why not get my dogs something--well these were cheap and seemed like such a good price for a big supply of treats---and if you are buying dog treats, you know how expensive they can be....well, I don't have 100% proof that the treats did this to my dog, but the week I was giving these to my lab and to my other dog, a maltese, the lab was getting sick throughout the week--throwing up, etc....I don't know if he was not eating them properly--maybe he wasn't chewing them all the way up, but he doesn't always chew up food and doesn't throw it up---I don't know--I hate to blame these treats, but when we stopped giving them to him, he stopped throwing up---so I think something was wrong w/them.....just use caution--a cheap price isn't all that cheap when your dog gets sick and you spend 3x as much on cleaning products to clean up your house!!  My maltese didn't seem to be bothered by them, but then again he really didn't eat but maybe one of them---another sign that something must have been wrong w/them as he eats ANYTHING!!!",DO NOT BUY--My dog got sick!
"summarize: This shampoo does, first of all, what shampoo ought to do: it cleans my hair. That's a positive.<br /><br />However, this shampoo also claims to help nourish and replenish the scalp, leading to healthier hair. I can tell some of this seems to be happening, but honestly my hair is too short to really notice the benefits.<br /><br />It is definitely effective for my dandruff--that much is clear to me. So, it works well as an anti-dandruff and does seem to provide the ""healthier"" hair look and feel.<br /><br />But if you're hair is fairly short and simple, you might not notice much besides the lack of flakes.","Works well, but unneeded for short hair"
"summarize: This big, delicious, moist and chewy cookie fits the bill for a great on-the-go breakfast or travel meal. Note that one serving is half a cookie, which would be plenty as a dessert or snack. But a whole cookie makes a meal, and is very filling.<br />Read the ingredient list carefully and you will see one *important* difference between this brand and other ""healthy"" cookie or pastry-bar type treats: (organic) WHOLE wheat flour. Not ""wheat flour"", which is the same as white flour, and has no nutritional value.<br />Another plus is that even the chocolate chips in the cookie are sweetened with low-glycemic malted barley, not cane sugar.<br />I'm looking forward to trying more varieties of Nana's cookies.",The best cookie and a great breakfast treat.
"summarize: Confession: I have been a true fan of Starbucks. I used to think Starbucks was the best coffee ever and the many bags of Starbucks in my pantry will prove that! However, I recently received a gift of a half pound of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DYSK"">illy Caffe Normale Drip/Medium Grind (Blue Band) Coffee, 8.8 Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a>and I was for once in my life, truly impressed with the quality, flavor, and aroma of this coffee. I also find this to be heartbreaking as I do not know what to do with all my Starbucks that I have on hand. I just gave 3 pounds of my Starbucks to my mother-in-law since I will not be drinking it anymore. If you are a true coffee conesseiur then you will love Illy coffee. If I ever open a coffee shop, I would be more than happy to invest in this company.",Illy Coffee is out of this world!
"summarize: I've got a Shih Tzu and a Jack Russell mix. I had no idea how large these FunBites were. After receiving the package, I realized it was too large for the Shih Tzu. He and the Jack Russell mix are the same size, but the mix is younger and has a larger mouth. I didn't even try to give it to the elderly Shih Tzu.<br /><br />The other guy liked it very much. He carried it off and alternately chewed on it and hid it. He quickly got the coating off and essentially made it into two treats--a rawhide and a munchy. He sometimes has a sensitive stomach but had no problems with this one. It took him about 24 hours to devour the whole thing. I'll probably give him one a week.",Too Big for Some Small Dogs
"summarize: I drink two cups of coffee each morning and I make them with a pod brewer. I used to drink more. I'd make a pot of coffee in the morning and drink it all day. Sometimes I'd do two pots. It seemed that just the thought of that coffee waiting for me was all it took to get me out into the kitchen and pour another cup. The pod brewer was the answer. Now I make a cup when I get up and have my second cup with breakfast.<br /><br />I do have several different kinds of coffee, but after having tried this, I've been mostly sticking with it, because it's dark and rich and very good with kind of an earth taste that I really like.<br /><br />In fact this coffee is so good that sometimes, not all the time, but sometimes, I'll take a third cup upstairs with me to my home office. If you haven't tried this, I think you should. I think you'll like it.",Dark and Rich and Very Good
"summarize: I've tried this tea by the bag and it does tend to be milder than your average supermarket Tetley or Lipton. But I've been drinking Bigelow Green Tea that way for about a year and I wanted to revisit Earl Grey via a Keurig-clone machine I got for my birthday over the summer. After I went through a couple of ""variety packs"" I picked up an Ekobrew Refillable basket and started drinking expresso done that way for my morning coffee. I admit, using a Keurig machine is still a bit low tech compared to just asking for ""Earl Grey, hot"" in my best Patrick Stewart imitation (which isn't very good) but give Mr. Coffee 10-20 years and they'll come up with a voice-activated machine. After all, if I'd wanted to pay another c-note per month, the car I've been leasing since last year could have come with that technology.",The Step Between the Bags & Captain Picard's Way

"summarize: I use these hamburger buns all the time when traveling. I toast them, throw them in a plastic baggie, and have a fast food burger with my own bun. I agree with other reviewers that they are not great when not toasted. And I found a local bakery that makes great, fresh, gluten free buns for use at home. But these hold up really well in a suitcase. They do not crumble, and while they are a tad dry, that works better for me when traveling (so they don't crumble when eating in the car). You can put ketchup, or other sauce on the burger, to cut down on some of the dryness. But, they are much better toasted. If you travel, and need to toast, you can use Tosta Bags so your food doesn't get cross-contaminated.",Great for travel and on-the-run hamburgers....(if toasted)
"summarize: I am a Rooibos junkie. I have been drinking it for a few years and adore it. I can only tolerate limited caffeine, early in my day or I'll be up and cranky and not ready to face the world the following day.  Rooibos, in a regular tea strength, with milk is a caffeine free and still tasty (tastes like black tea, when brewed properly, with a little less of the note of bitterness)...<br /><br />I also love espresso drinks and worked for a long time as a barista in a cafe. So I figured this would be the perfect blend for me...<br /><br />I followed the bag directions but as I am sans espresso machine I prepared an entire pot in my trusty Bodum french press.<br /><br />I guess a person who enjoys a straight espresso might enjoy this, but without sweetener and milk it really did taste like superconcentrated, over-brewed regular tea.  I added milk and that dry, bitterness was still clear as a bell and not enjoyable.<br /><br />So I dumped the RedEspresso and started fresh. I prepared my usual cup of afternoon Rooibos, using my usual amounts (much less than that suggested for espresso prep on the package) and yum. Perfection.<br /><br />So would I buy this tea again?<br />Sure. It is packaged well and secure, it seems to be high quality rooibos, and I can get it from Amazon.com so I probably will order this again, for use as a regular rooibos.",Good Rooibos (but I'm not diggin' the espresso strength thing)
"summarize: Okay so I found out about these two weeks ago when my mother brought them home from our local Hanford's supermarket. I have to say is that they taste amazing! I think they out rank in my books the cafe escapes because of the taste quality they bring. Now everyone has a different opinion because it's proven that everyone's taste buds are not the same (even in genetics of people i the same family!), so my opinion could differ due to just our own taste buds.<br /><br />Anyway, my point is, I think these k-cups are great! The only issue I have is this: they need to package mini marshmallows into each box, attached to the bottom of each k-cup lol this way everyone can have marshmallows or not just like the original packages. Other than that, the recipe for this flavor of k-cup hot chocolate is awesome! Worth the money :)",Just as awesome as the regular packets!
"summarize: I tried three different brands of ginger tea and I think this one is the best. This is not in a sachet. Ginger is dried into granules (way better) and mixed with a sweetener like cane sugar or honey. This brand brews dark which is the way I like it. The other brands were light in color but they tasted okay. This one is closer to the brand I used to buy in China, but the Chinese brand was much stronger. I like to drink this during the flu and cold seasons and when I've had a heavy meal and need to settle my stomach before bedtime. This is the kind of tea you will either love or hate. I love it! The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the cane sugar which I do not use. I prefer liquid sugar or sugar in the raw. Otherwise, this is a great drink.",Good ginger tea with a little kick
"summarize: I really like the Prima Taste Rendang Curry Sauce Kit. This was a test of a competing brand. Although there is a definite difference in taste, they are both equally exotic for your taste buds. The Prima Taste has a distinctive lemongrass taste. The Asian Home has a distinctive medium hot chili taste. I added vegetables to both and served over rice from my rice cooker. Just as you might like 2 distinct fried chickens -say Popeye's cajun and KFC's herbs and spices- both of these Rendangs were very satisfying. If you only cook the Asian Home with your meat, you are definitely going to experience heat and a stronger spice taste. Here's my recipe that created 8 platefuls and reduced the chili heat:<br /><br />I added the Asian Home to a can of coconut milk and heated it in a covered non-stick Dutch oven. I added a lb. of thinly sliced round steak and simmered it 10 mins. I gently covered that with thin slices of a full broccoli stem and flowerette. After 10 min. I added thin celery slices, a standard can of straw mushrooms sliced and a standard can of bamboo shoots cubed small. (You can add carrot toothpick slices or red bell pepper for color.) Cook 10 minutes. By keeping the cover on you will  have some sauce on everything. Serve over rice for an all-in-one meal. Salt if you desire (I thought it brought out the flavor.)<br /><br />This is much more economical than the Prima Taste. You can achieve the lemongrass taste by adding some lemon juice. If you are used to a little sweetness, sprinkle a little sugar on top.",Very nice flavor and you can stretch it
"summarize: I'm a home brewer and make wine, beer, and root beer.  I have tried several different extracts for root beer flavoring and this one is simply the best and very easy to use.  I dump the whole bottle into a fermenting/bottling bucket with water (5 gallon total liquid when done), 5 lb sugar, and about 1/2 teaspoon of yeast nutrient and a packet of champagne yeast.  After everything is mixed well I bottle and cap it (makes around 50 12oz bottles) and let it mature for a few weeks in the basement.  The bottling process only takes about an hour (with sanitizing bottles) and I have several folks that have been wild about the end result.",Great Product for Making Root Beer
"summarize: When I first looked at this bonsai and the pictures of what other people had received, I thought this would be a great purchase. However, I bought the $6.95 tree from 9GreenBox instead of the $12.48 tree from Bonsai Boy. I wish I had spent the extra money. The tree cannot be more than a season and a half old (while the description says that it is a 3-year-old tree), and is about 3 1/2"" - 4"" tall. That being said, there is plenty of new growth and it was packaged well (no breakage and soil was still wet) and I received it quicker than I was expecting.","Buy from Bonsai Boy, not 9GreenBox"
"summarize: Our kid loves these pouches, but due to another reviewer saying it was for one box of four pouches, the only reason I purchased these was because they were priced at four dollars and change.<br /><br />When the box arrived from Amazon, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that I paid under five bucks for 4 BOXES of four pouches each (for a total of sixteen pouches). So thank you other reviewer, for driving the price down ;)<br /><br />I'll definitely buy them again in the future, even back up at the full price. It's certainly a better price than our local Safeway/Raley's has.",Price IS for 4 boxes of 4 pouches each
"summarize: A review for cookies?  Why not?<br /><br />My wife and I love Oreos.  Every once in a while she picks up a bag at the store and we eat some with milk.<br /><br />The problem is that we feel compelled to finish off the bag before they get stale.  Since all the kids are gone that's tough.  It's not really good for us and after 3 or 4 nights it gets kind of old.<br /><br />Recently she got a 12 pack assortment of cookies which contained Oreos, Nutter Butters, etc.  I wondered if there was a way to just buy a whole bunch of ""snack packs"" for Oreos and sure enough Amazon has them.<br /><br />Now we can have that 6 cookie ""fix"" without having to remember to pick them up at the store or worry about them going stale if we don't finish them off.",A great way to get your cookie fix.
"summarize: UPDATE:<br />The company determined that the product I received was defective in some way. They speculated it got too hot during storage or shipping. They replaced it for me at no charge. Everything is good. The replacement food is great.<br /><br />Here's my original review after a little editing, including further details of the resolution:<br /><br />I have been buying the ""Organic Liver for Dogs"" from my local store. The consistency (firmness and uniformity) of the product had been good. So I ordered a case of it from Amazon. When it arrived, I opened two cans immediately, excited to give my dog some more organic beef liver. However, both cans contained small pellets of something (liver?) and water. It was nothing at all like the same product that I have been purchasing locally, even though the label is the same and it is sold as the same product.<br /><br />I wasn't even sure if it was safe to feed it to my dog. The cans from Amazon are simply liquid plus a handful of pellets.<br /><br />As I look through the reviews now, I see there is a consistency problem with Newman's Own Organics pet foods. Some batches appear OK, but some are not edible (even by dogs). I sense a serious quality control problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow returns of this product. I opened two cans. Now I have the rest of the case that I'm afraid to feed to my dog. I can shake all the cans and hear that they are all liquid plus pellets (as opposed to the firm liver puree that was in the cans I purchased locally).<br /><br />UPDATE: I wrote the company and they quickly resolved the issue for me by sending me a new order at no cost. The new order has arrived now and the product is fine. It has the proper consistency. It looks exactly like the very good quality dog food that I was used to when I purchased this brand locally. So everything is resolved for me.<br /><br />I give the food itself a 5 star rating. Where else can one find certified organic beef liver for dogs in a convenient form and at a fair price? I think this product is the best available to me at this time, so it has to be rated 5 stars.<br />I give the customer service from Newman's Own Organics a 5 star rating as well.<br />I have a few reservations about quality control, based not only on my own experience, but on what I read in other reviews here. Fortunately, the company will stand behind its product and resolve any issues. Therefore, the lowest rating I could give for quality control would be 3 stars.<br />Overall, I think I would rate the product 4.5 stars. Since the customer service was so outstanding and the product is the best I have found of this type, I'll round up to 5 stars.",Certified organic liver for my dog! I'm very glad this product is on the market.
"summarize: Doesn't really taste like coconut - It may be no use to write this description for folks who do not like coconut flavor, as I'm sure they won't likely be shopping for anything with ""coconut"" in the title, but there you have it - doesn't really taste like coconut.<br /><br />Fact is, Amy & Brian Natural Coconut Juice Pulp Free has exceedingly little flavor at all, and what flavor there is rides down your throat as a vaguely fresh fruit/fresh vegetation flavor, decidedly not sweet, not tart - just mild, easy to gulp refreshment.<br /><br />As to the promised effects - yes, this will hydrate you quite quickly, restore a sense of energy, and make it easier to face work outdoors in the heat.  More importantly, no crash like sugary sweet drinks.  It also has staved off leg cramps for me - just as well as, if not better than scarfing down bananas - take a note of the potassium content on this one.<br /><br />As to other brands, you've got the ones with sugar, or even worse, HFC.  They of course taste sweeter, and usually have coconut bits in them.  Shop ethnic groceries and enjoy, but do note the sugar.  As to the more readily available non-sugared ones (Zico, O.N.E., etc)  I just think Amy & Brian taste a bit better as Amy & Brian does not have the funny aftertaste that I've detected in those cardboard carton brands.

"summarize: This seasoning is very tasty and versatile and highly concentrated, so you really don't need much to add flavor to any food.  The flavor works well with any style of food - Latin American, Italian, American, etc. - so it will be a handy seasoning to have in your cupboard.  I put some on my fried egg this morning that I prepared with tomato and fresh basil and it was delicious, but the garlic-y flavor is still lingering in my mouth. It does contain MSG, but since the flavor is concentrated, the MSG content may not be a concern for some.  One 1/4 tsp. has 60 mg of sodium, but for many foods, you will only need to sprinkle on a very small amount to enhance the flavor.  It would be a good addition to a sandwich along with mayonnaise or other sandwich spreads.  The seasoning contains dehydrated vegetables (garlic and onion), msg, spices, herbs and tricalcium phosphate (anti-caking agent). For many, this could become the perfect go-to seasoning.  You could also add it to other herbs to even further reduce the msg/sodium content.",Very Tasty - But contains MSG!
"summarize: Note that the description provided by the...(?)...producer or merchant of this product says it's filled with ""gurlic.""  Maybe that's true.  However, the primary ingredient of this ""seasoning"" is nothing but MSG.  Then it has pepper.  Then some more MSG.  Then maybe a few specks of some type of powder, which I presume is some derivative of MSG.  Then it has one flake of oregano.  Then it has MSG.  Then it has one speck of parsley flakes.  Then it claims to have onion powder, but I think it's just more MSG.  Finally, it has MSG-powder, MSG-salt and MSG-flakes.  Perfect stuff for your next MSG-induced nightmare headache, the likes of which you've never known.  Other than that, you'll probably like this stuff.<br /><br />Edited to respond to the lone critic who claims this does NOT have MSG...an individual I can only surmise is a shareholder or employee of Goya...so, here's the ingredient list for you people, since he, while claiming it has no MSG (not true), failed to provide it himself:<br /><br />Ingredients: Salt, Granulated Garlic, Tricalcium Phosphate (prevents caking), Monosodium Glutamate, Oregano, Black Pepper, Tumeric, Onion Powder, Spices.<br /><br />Note that ""spices"" can also be termed to include MSG as well, but here they go the extra measure and at least spell it out for you...something this other reviewer must have missed or be unable to read.<br /><br />So, there you have it.

If you've ever tried another brand, you'd know and once you try Haribo, you'd never go back!<br /><br />These Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears are just Bursting with Flavor! They are soft and chewy. (But not so soft that they are sticky and stick to your teeth)! I've loved these since I was young and now my son loves them too. They come in about six different flavors and each one is yummy!

It tastes just like peanut butter only not as sweet or rich.  I loved its mild flavor so much, it has a great texture and the smell is so inviting.

The taste differences are noticeable, but I don't have a strong favorite. I use the pods for convenience, although I also roast my own green beans for espresso as well.<br /><br />If you look at the negative reviews, they're mostly on the ""best before"" dates being passed. While I would also be upset to spend money and get ""expired"" pods, I should point out that the pods are good for quite some time after their nominal expiration dates. I just found a handful of these Espressione Classic pods with 2002 (this is late 2009 now) dates and they made acceptable, though not spectacular espresso. Basically they're vacuum packed and not much is happening inside the wrapper.",Excellent pods that I've used in my Briel espresso unit for years
"summarize: I really like the size of the pieces and the tenderness of the jerky I've had so far. I've only had one of the 4 packages that come in an order. I am not thrilled with the Teriyaki flavor but it's ok, not too salty. The sweet hot is really hot so beware. This brand is the first jerky I am willing to re-order, which says a lot.

"summarize: After being diagnosed with Celiacs disease, I had a heck of a time finding a gluten free pasta that I liked.  When I found this quinoa pasta at Whole Foods, it became my favorite.  Once you figure out the right cooking time, it won't disappoint. We are in Albuquerque (high altitude)so it takes exactly nine minutes to perfect aldente. It has a nice flavor, but lets face it - once you get the texture right -  pasta is really about the sauce anyway. The noodles are a little on the thin side, which is why I say it used to be my favorite:  I have since found Tinkyada Brown Rice Spaghetti with Rice Bran - My new favorite. The noodles are thicker like wheat spaghetti. And they have the perfect texture and flavor when cooked properly. But that's a different review...

A trade-off in using natural fruit juices is higher calorie content, so perhaps the tall, slim design of the can and its smaller volume is intended to help offset, both psychologically and materially, the reality of consuming an 80 calorie drink.<br /><br />However, Izze does not fare as well with competitive products from R.W. Knudsen whose drinks are made with 100% juice and are offered in 12 fluid ounce cans for about the same price as Izze. But perhaps more tellingly, Knudsen does not feel compelled to fortify their drinks with needless vitamins nor do they wear their corporate philanthropy on their sleeves to the extent that Izze feels compelled to do. One wonders if all this might be due to Pepsi's acquisition of Izze in 2006; the benefit of Pepsi's sales and distribution network might have come at the cost of marketing hyperbole and the production of a slightly less desirable product.<br /><br />Still, Izze shows that the soft drink industry is on the right track. If you normally consume artifically-sweetened soft drinks, choosing to enjoy the unique taste experience of Izze's all-natural product line (with delicious specialty flavors such as grapefruit and pomegranate) should be an easy decision for you to make. But if you are a little more finicky and prefer an 100% juice drink, you might also look into some of the other alternatives that are available to you.",Far superior to your local vending machine
"summarize: I very much enjoyed this vermicelli.  I've never had this type of noodle before, but I love how quick to prepare it is and how well it soaks up the sauce you put it in.  Its very tasty and pretty healthy to boot.<br /><br />The main problem I have with it is the packaging gives you NO clue how to prepare it.  Its very vague.  I figured it out after looking up stuff online.  I'm sure if you're used to using vermicelli this kind of thing won't bother you.  But I had never used it before, and some tips for a guy like me would've been appreciated.","Fast, yummy, and good for you, but the packaging could use some work."
"summarize: The grape flavor is great. It's nice and sour, the Xylitol isn't too sweet and it's actually good for your dental health!<br /><br />I liked them so much, I ordered some of the Fruit Punch flavor, but those were a complete disappointment, as they had no real flavor and certainly were not at all sour.<br /><br />Only 4 star, rather than five, because the flavor is strongest on the outside. The sour fades fairly quickly, with the interior not having the same zing. Still nice as a sugar free candy that provides some of that sourness some of us sometimes crave.<br /><br />Each piece is small, so you'll probably want two or three at a time to maximize the flavor.",The grape are great! Nice and sour.
"summarize: OK, so I can't tell if it's making that much of a difference as far as milk production goes.  I've done pretty well regardless, but have tried both this tea as well as the Traditional Medicine version and haven't noticed a difference between the two.<br /><br />I don't really have a reason to be paranoid, but I tried the teas to halp build up my freezer stopck of milk in case I have any issues with production and need a good supply of back-up.  As a result I've tried the teas and brewers yeast pills.  I didn't see a significant increase, but they have served as a security blanket of sorts for me :-)<br /><br />However, I wanted to put this review up because so many of the others talk about how tasty the Yogi version is. I just wanted to say that I think the Traditional Medicines and Yogi tea versions taste almost exactly the same, so go with whichever you find the best deal on!","Pleasant enough tea, not sure if it helps with lactation..."
"summarize: My 5 year old cat adores the food. She scarfed down as much as I put in her bowl, so I had to be careful not to overfeed. She definitely liked this much than the other Wellness brand options.<br /><br />Since this is a very unique, extremely high protein food, you might want to talk to your vet about contraindications (kidney problems, old age?) before making the switch.<br /><br />You might also want to check out <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X96YIK"">Spa Select Indoor Cat Food, 7 lbs.</a>, the only other food my cat goes bananas for.

"summarize: This tea is reminiscent of the great outdoors...fresh crisp mountain air, sighing wind in the trees, standing next to the warmth of the campfire holding a steaming mug of Lapsang Souchong tea.  It doesn't get any better than this.  You can have that same feeling as you brew this tea in your home or office, I do, almost daily during the winter and often during late Summer nights out in the back yard in my lawn chair.  This tea is an acquired taste for most, but well worth the effort.  Give yourself several cups to get over the unusually different taste, savor the instant shift to the outdoors, and enjoy a tea that is my favorite of all time and teas!","Tastes like a good, warm campfire smells, wonderful!"
"summarize: Being a big fan of carbonated soft drinks, juice drinks and the black cherry flavor, I couldn't wait to get my free sample from Vine. The old adage ""Be careful what you wish for"" has rarely applied more than to The Switch Black Cherry product. The black cherry flavor was like drinking cough medicine. The overall lingering taste in the mouth after swallowing is very unpleasant. Further, the 8.3 fl oz drink is high in total carbs (35g), sugar (33g) and calories (130). My overall opinion of this product is that it is not worth drinking -- even for free. If these observations don't turn you off, drink up and enjoy!","If You Like A Heavily Medicinal-Tasting Soft Drink With A Long-Lasting Unpleasant Aftertaste,Then Switch Black Cherry Is For You"
"summarize: I have found the perfect combination that is helping me lose weight. First off let me tell you that I lost 50+ pounds the good old fashioned way...diet and exercise. Then I hit a plateau and it refused to come off. For 3 months I have gone up and down 6 pounds. Desperate to get over the hump, and lose the last 60 pounds I researched all the different products that are touted as ""miracle"" remedies. And I actually think I found the perfect combination for me. I have lost about 1 and a half pounds a day since I started!<br /><br />What you ask? Drumroll please. My combination is:<br /><br />1.

"summarize: Very odd product.  Can says No GM ingredients (Genetically Modified?) but the ingredients include partially hydrogenated canola and palm oils.  Yucky source of transfats so be aware that thsi imported product contains 2g trans fat per serving...and each can has 3.5 servings.<br /><br />Taste wise - in my opinion, tastes like soggy, wet fruitcake (not in any good way at all).  WAY TOO SWEET and I even got a few bites with a sandy, gritty, crunch texture which was horrible and I can only hope it was from the raisins?!<br /><br />This product is not pleasant tasting at all so I am just not sure about all the other great reviews.  But for my taste, I couldn't choke down even a few bites of this stuff.  Only thing I appreciated from this was the few laughs from friends/family over the name of this Heinz product.",Tastes like wet fruitcake to me
"summarize: Normally my daughter's Pomeranian is fed a diet of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W5U5H6"">Taste of the Wild Dry Dog Food, Hi Prairie Canine Formula with Roasted Bison & Venison, 15-Pound Bag</a>, or another of their variety's of dry dog food.  Thanks to some previous recommendations (a nice chart/web site that compared the various dog food products and rated them based on meat content, grain and other by-product inclusion, etc.), we'd settled on that as one of the better quality products to feed to our furry little friend.  Unfortunately there were issues with a recall related to possible salmonella in the dog food that required taking back one bag of the T.o.t.W. food, but even that was quickly enough resolved by the local store we tend to get her food from (that bag was accepted back for store credit, with me already having obtained a bag of another flavor T.o.t.W. product that wasn't on the recall list), and at this point the recall issues are long resolved for us.<br /><br />To get back on topic, our furry friend crunches through the small handfuls of the T.o.t.W. product about as quickly as we give it to her.  Like most dogs, she has no concept of ""full"" and will eat whatever is put in front of her and then come back for more.  Normally it is probably more correct to say she inhales her food, though I do hear her crunching on each piece so I know she's at least chewing it up before swallowing it.  Trying out a different brand is something we do cautiously as making too drastic a change to the diet seems to wind up providing us a dog that is capable of some pretty nasty biological output of the very odoriferous type (how a smell that potent can be emitted by such a small dog, I don't have a clue, but whew!).  On the other hand though, we do like to offer the dog a variety of food so she can enjoy something different and not just be stuck eating the same old dry food again and again.<br /><br />This Chef Michael's food, a product from Purina, a pet food manufacturer I remember from many, many years ago (back in my youth), sold itself to me in the ""Grilled Sirloin"" name.  Meat in general seems to be a favorite of the family dog, but especially beef flavors, so it seemed an easy assumption that she'd like this product.  In that area, I wasn't wrong.  As I gave her a good sized handful of food in her bowl she pulled out a chunk and went off to the side where she went to work on chewing it up and savoring the taste a bit before she decided it was something she needed to go back to get more of.  Sure enough, that chunk was quickly enough swallowed up and the rest of the bowl was soon emptied.<br /><br />When I put the handful of food in the bowl I noticed that the food itself did seem to resemble pieces of meat.  Definitely not a dry kibble type food, but more along the lines of a moist meat product, perhaps along the side of say a stick of pepperoni or perhaps a Slim Jim (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DT3VHS"">Slim Jim Giant Slim Pepperoni, .97-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a>).  Or, perhaps more along the lines of something I'd expect to see in a beef stew.  In that area, well, lets just say that if there was a category for ""visual"" appeal on the part of the human, this product would get a decent score.  But, well, there's the question of just what is in the product and that is where I'd have to say I'm not as inclined to consider purchasing this product too often.<br /><br />This would seem to be a product that falls more on the lower (half) end of the quality scale when it comes to not being comprised of too many fillers and products that aren't as necessary in a dog's diet.  From past experience in researching what to feed the dog, I'd long ago learned that many of what I'd call lower quality foods are filled with, well, lots of fillers.  While dogs will eat it and not really care, they don't need those fillers and given that it isn't that much more expensive to buy higher quality products, I've tried to keep our pet on a diet that would hopefully be better for her in the longer term.<br /><br />As an occasional change of pace in our dog's diet, I think this would be an ok product.  Perhaps just as a ""treat"" every now and then, but I just don't see myself rushing out to get more bags of this product instead of the Taste of the Wild products, or other products that I tend to have a bit more respect for.","Woof! Woof! Woof, woof, woof! (... or, apparently tastes great, but...)"
"summarize: I was disappointed to have spent the money and then find that my cat does not really like this food.  She will eat it if she's starving and even then I have to sit near and coax her.  She loves Fancy Feast and I only feed her the non-seafood ones and the ones that do not contain wheat gluten (both cause allergic reactions in her) so that narrows her diet down to the FF classic turkey, chicken, and beef.  I hoped to add some variety with this Wellness and hoped to get away from buying cat food with by-products in it but Wellness chicken is not the answer.  It's too thick and sticky.  Too bad for me because it smells WAY better than the Fancy Feast.",She eats it but it's like pulling teeth
"summarize: I bought this product as an alternative to other diet sodas (the ""big two"" will remain nameless) mainly because I wanted to get away from the aspartame artificial sweetener. I've heard ""bad things"" about aspartame but after doing my own research on it I couldn't find any conclusive research or studies proving it was as bad as people claimed. There are tons of sites that say all these bad things it does to you, but nobody can give me a single study proving any of what they say. I tend to think this thing against aspartame is more of a conspiracy then anything else.<br /><br />But regardless, I decided to lower my intake of aspartame and try this Zevia, since it's sweetened with Stevia. The taste is certainly lacking and while it doesn't taste horrible, when comparing it to the major players in the industry - it stinks. A very bland taste and there is very little carbonation.<br /><br />Did I mention it gave me horrible gas and bloating? You know the kind that sits with you all day long and just gives you an unsettled stomach? The reason for this is that it has a sugar alcohol in it called ""erythritol"" and if you know anything about sugar alcohols, they almost always give you an upset stomach, gas, and/bloating. Sugar alcohols are what those sugar free, low carb chocolates have in them. And while wikipedia states that this sugar alcohol ""shouldn't"" be as bad as the other more notorious ones, like xylitol, because none of it ""supposedly"" reaches the large intestine...let's just say I would disagree.<br /><br />If aspartame is so bad for you then why is that these products sweetened with stevia cause discomfort in some people? You'd think the ""bad"" product would be the one where you actually notice the side effects. At $1 a can (compare that to less then 30 cents a can for other cola brands), coupled with the potential unwanted discomfort, I think you might wanna stay away from this product.",The taste certainly lacks & it gave me gas and bloating...
"summarize: I finally learned how to make Chi Chi's chimichanga.  It's not an easy recipe and takes many steps, but when I'm in the mood, it's worth it to have a dish I absolutely love.  This seasoning is essential to make it taste perfect.<br /><br />Last night, I took leftover beef stew (actually, it was beef ragout, which has tomatoes and onions, not potatoes in the mix) and added chili peppers and this seasoning.  When it was hot, I put the meat and some cheese in the flour tortillas, then more cheese and gravy over the top and heated it a little longer in the oven.  It made a delicious wet beef burrito.  This seasoning is very versatile.  Though I had to buy 24 of these - I'll do it again and again, when needed.  I've shared them with my sister when she wants to make these dishes and my daughter-in-law.<br /><br />This is not a taco seasoning.  It is a much different flavoring and until you taste it - you won't know.  Yum.",My favorite seasoning for Mexican dishes
"summarize: I usually purchase this at my local store but I will be purchasing it here.  I have read several reviews, seems people love it or hate it. For those that dislike it, there seems to be a back and forth on too much apple vs. too much cinnamon or too bitter vs. too sweet. Like anything else, both are a matter of individual taste.  For those who found it too bitter (spicy), from my experience I have found that if you steep it (using boiling water) for 4 mins (remove the bag)in an 8 to 12oz cup it lessens the zing that the cinnamon packs. What is really nice for the diabetics out there is that the cinnamon helps with the glucose levels and this tea carries a bonus in that it is sweet.  I do not add sugar or sugar subs to my drinks so this tea is really a sweet treat for me.  Artificial sweeteners are really popular with many diabetics I know but they are not good for your health. So if you are looking for no caffeine sweet cinnamon tea, this is it. Hey, it is worth trying. The true motto for most diabetics.",This review is for the diabetics out there
"summarize: First, if you look at the picture on the front, you see large pieces of nuts attached to a an O. I understand this is enlarged, but the reality is the nuts are much smaller relative to the O; more like a coating that an attached piece. They were largely encapuslated in the sugar coating. There was no distinct flavor or texture of nut and O, just one experience.<br /><br />The O is not like a cheerio. Instead it is a sugary construct, sort of like captain crunch but a little less sweet. The sugar coating either has honey or honey flavor. In any case, the honey makes for an odd taste as there is a floral overtone to the cereal that doesn't belong. I don't get this with ""Honey bunches of Oats"" or the like, but have experienced in a cereal called ""Puffins"".<br /><br />I have four kids (5 through 13) and, although they ate mose of the cereal, no one was eager for more and a few didn't finish. I certainly wouldn't buy this again. There are tastier and healthier (at the same time!) alternatives.","Not very good, Odd tasting, Not popular with my kids"
"summarize: First things first: yum!<br /><br />I've been trying to eat more healthful foods, and I've been especially cutting out things like canned junk. But this is pure yummy, healthy goodness in a can! The only real downside is that it is a bit expensive, but I'll take that over cheap ""tomato soup"" any day. This ""light in sodium"" version is already ridiculously tasty, so I'm not sure what more I'd get out of the regular version, other than excess salt. :)<br /><br />I've kinda liked tomato soup in the past, but whatever Amy's put in there has made me simply love it. This stuff is thick and tasty just on its own, or with minimal additives. I like to just add a dash of black pepper myself.",A rare exception to canned food hell
"summarize: We've re-ordered the original potato Popchips several times since we first tried them.  They are perfect for snackers who crave salty crunchy things more than sweets.  There's only 100 calories per bag and you actually get enough to feel satisfied.  We've tried the sweet potato and jalapeno flavors with less desirable results.  They taste too manufactured to us - the flavor is too intense.  We much prefer the basic original chip that remind us so much of Munchos.  They are nicely salty and have a great crunch.  They would make great crunchy toppings in recipes as opposed to breadcrumbs though I haven't tried anything beyond slipping a few onto my turkey sandwiches.  (Right, like you've never done it.)",Love the original - not so much the jalapeno or the sweet potato.
"summarize: First thing first, I have noticed this is the only package/favor from Fancy Feast doesn't contain wheat gluten, while other favors have it list as #3 or 4 product on the list.

Until recently, I have always been disappointed with cheesy, uninteresting artwork and sub-par chocolates from Cadbury's and the like. I was skeptical when buying this from Amazon because it was so much cheaper than other calendars on this site, but boy was i wrong - this could be the same calendar I got as a kid! This is a real German calendar with real German chocolate and an old-timey hand-drawn Christmas scene (it's just printed of course, I don't mean someone drew each box!).

"summarize: This tastes great.  Its smooth, no weird off tastes, no aftertastes, no stomach problems that coffee usually gives me.  Personally this one is a bit too sweet for my taste, even without adding sugar the amaretto is a tad overpowering, but then again I prefer really strong bitter coffee.  This goes great with dessert like materials as the sweetness is complimented by anything else sweet you may encounter.  Though for a 'first thing in the morning' cup, I need something with less sweetness like their original java flavor or their insanely delicious chocolate mint.

"summarize: I love Torani Syrup and these flavors are great! Made with cane sugar, not corn syrup, which is a huge plus. Taste great in hot chocolate, herbal tea and steamed milk. Great for Italian sodas too.<br /><br />However, the product description says absolutely nothing about the fact that these bottles are plastic and not glass bottles that Torani Syrup is usually packaged in. The plastic bottles don't have as long of a shelf life (2 years compared to 3 years for the glass bottles). The plastic that they are made with (PET) has not been proven to be safe. I don't like the idea of chemicals (antimony and phthalates) leaking into the syrup over a long period of time because it's going to take a while to use up all of the syrup.

"summarize: I have the EZ Green Sprouter.  When I bought mine, I bought the seeds from the same company too.  The cost was a bit pricey so I checked Amazon's.

Not only do these seeds produce green blades of lush grass, but there is NO mold!  Whereas in the seeds from the EZ Green Sprouter, their seeds grow skinny, light green and moldy wheatgrass.  I love my EZ Green Sprouter, but their seeds cannot even compare to this merchant's!  Normally once my wheatgrass starts to mold, I would have to start cutting them, separate the mold and then extract the juice.  With these seeds?

"summarize: I was skeptical, little Ms. Pepper can be finicky.  We were at a pet store recently and the pet store told us that every dog loves their treats, and our dog turned up her nose and walked away.  She had no interest.

(she's also very stubborn)  She sat, her little paws shaking, she wanted that treat so bad.  I said take it like a lady.  And ever so gently she took the biscuit.  And then she ate like a hog.<br /><br />The biscuits are bigger than the treats we normally give her.  They smell fresh.  There doesn't appear to be any artificial color in it, at least it doesn't stain her beard.  I really feel good about giving Pepper these treats, and she seems pleased as punch to get them.  I've honestly never seen her that excited about a treat.  We'll have to get them once and awhile, she actually listens when these are waiting in the wings.<br /><br />*UPDATE* We just bought more of these for Ms. Pepper and I'm not kidding you, when she saw the bag she did a little dance about sat at my feet and just waited.

summarize: I love vita coco and this drink is great but with horrible after taste. This flavor has more potassium( 21% vs 19%) than the pineapple flavor so this was the main reason for me trying this. The flavor is great while drinking but the after taste is horrible. Its mostly acai flavor after taste and Im not a big fan of acai. The acai basically over powers the pomergranate and coconut but its still a refeshing flavor. Overall I would not by this flavor again if I had the chance. Hopefully the tangerine one comes back so I can give that one a try.,Great product but horrible after taste
"summarize: Orijen makes by far the best dog food you can buy. It's expensive but well worth it, especially when you take into account how much you will save on vet bills and the great boost it will give to your dogs overall health and well being.. It is grain free which is very important as grain is not part of a dog's normal diet and besides mostly being filler, grains can cause allergies and other issues. My 5 year old German Shepherd is on Orijen Adult and has done incredibly well on it, stunning coat, great energy, consistently firm, and virtually odor-free, poops. I also have a large male Golden who is now 13 1/2 years old and doing fantastic. He at Orijen Senior until about 3 years ago when we switched him to Orijen Senior. Other than a little arthritis in his hips and knees (to be expected) he is perfectly healthy and his last blood panel came back incredibly good. My vet says we are doing all the right things (daily walks and exercise, filtered water, Orijen Senior food) especially since large Goldens typically only live to 10 or 11. When we are out walking quite often we meet much younger goldens (6 to 8 years) that look much older than he does. It really does show what a difference diet and exercise make both in humans and in our canine companions. We have a new puppy (that we adopted from the Best Friends Animal Society) and she is on a mix of Orijen Puppy and doing great. Highly recommend Orijen Adult, Senior and Puppy.<br /><br />Note:<br />Many years ago we fed our dogs Canidae because it was decent quality and we were financial limited. But, when the Canidae manufacturer suddenly changed their formula (added more grain and fillers) all of our dogs had bad reactions (diarrhea, vomiting, scratching, skin allergies etc). Numerous trips to the vet and lots of dollars for tests only to find out they were all having a reaction to the poor quality ingredients in their food. That was when I began researching dog food ingredients and decided to go grain-free with a company that only makes dog food. Could not be happier with my decision to spend more on Orijen. Very wise decision on my part, and my dogs are much healthy now than they have ever been.",The best grain free dog food
"summarize: I just bought this soda today at the Fresh Market, because it was made with agave nectar. I was blown away by how wonderful the taste was. I tried the Root Beer and the Watermelon Cream and I like them both. However, I think so far Watermelon Cream is my favorite. I would and will recommend this to anyone. Especially if they have diabetes or want a sugar alternative. This is a real treat. It has no aftertaste and tastes like a regular soda. It is a better choice than any of the other sugar substitute, diet sodas. This is the best!",This is an AWESOME alternative to regular soda!!!
"summarize: After reading up on cat nutrition, we ordered some of this and another high-end brand. Our 2 young cat brothers are used to Nutro and Friskies wet food, which makes up 50% of their diet (the rest dry).<br /><br />It looks similar in color and texture to ground beef, and is very sticky, like ground beef (but I'm guessing it's cooked).<br /><br />catinfo.org said Cowboy Cookout is formulated to mimic real mouse. Well, must be working, because our one cat took a half-can-sized slab, and ran with it dangling from his mouth like a trophy as I chased him around the house. Amazingly the huge chunk didn't fall apart until I caught him and he started to struggle. He kept doing this, I had to break it up so it doesn't stick together. So two thumbs up from him.<br /><br />The other cat wasn't a big fan, perhaps cause he's never had real beef (instead of beef byproducts?) - he kept stopping and looking around for something better to eat. He eventually finished his half-can, but took about 10 minutes to do so (during which I have to fight off his brother from stealing it).<br /><br />So make sure your cats like real beef, and the sticky consistency seems to make them take chunks from the bowl and eat it on the floor, which is messy. They don't do this with other wet foods. I will probably buy a chicken-based from Merrick next time.<br /><br />Edit: Changed to 5 stars, cause the only downside is your cat may not like beef, and I noticed it's the only can I've seen that doesn't appear to have a plastic (BPA) liner - bravo for that!",Mixed reviews of real beef from our cat brothers
"summarize: I drink my coffe black with one sugar.  I enjoy coffee with a strong, dark roasted, complex flavor and when I bought a simple pod brewer for my desk I was very disappointed with the initial weak tasting coffee that I purchased with the machine.<br /><br />I recently purchased this 3 pack with the hope that this coffee brewer was not bought in vain...<br /><br />This is only my second brew but I am pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Lets not confuse a quality drip or perculator with this pod coffee, but for what it is -- it is convienent and tasty.<br /><br />The one common down fall with these pod coffees is the strength to water ratio... I can overfill my machine with water to get a decent cup of coffee.<br /><br />I recommend this coffee pod.",tastey and reasonable -- for a pod coffee
"summarize: One of my friends is big into organic foods and introduced me to these crackers. They are extremely crunchy & crisp, reasonably low in calories (140 calories for 13 crackers) and don't contain any gluten, wheat or high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />They do have a slight nutty flavor, but the texture makes me think I am eating bird seed.<br /><br />They don't taste salty at all to me, but contain 190mg of sodium per serving.<br /><br />Obviously, if you have wheat or gluten allergies, these crackers could be perfect for you. If you are like me and eat pretty much anything there are better crackers out there, but these are probably a bit healthier than most.<br /><br />I would like to try other flavors, but I'm not willing to purchase a box of 12 just to find out I didn't like it. It would be nice if Amazon sold an assortment of 12.",Interesting product...can be difficult to find locally
"summarize: I'll admit it: I'm a freak. I don't like onions or garlic. Shoot me.<br /><br />Other than the evil alliums in this dressing, though, it's like serious salad dressing crack. There's something sweet and salty and vinegary about this dressing that combine in perfect harmony to make a really awesome dressing.<br /><br />Strangely, I like it OK in salads, but I like it even better on a sandwich. Ever get oil and vinegar on your sandwich? It's like that, only better. There's gotta be MSG in this stuff, because - wow, it's addictive.<br /><br />The onions and garlic definitely cheapen the flavor to me, so it only gets four stars, but if you like dried or granulated onions and garlic, you'll dig this dressing. Also good to dip soybeans in.","Too heavy on the onions and garlic, but tasty otherwise"
"summarize: I have two dogs who loved digging up my garden and loved digging under the fence.<br /><br />My in-laws got me a Fido-Shock and I set it up.  During install I decided to test it out, so I held the wire and waited for a zap... nothing.  I double checked the wiring, held it again, and... nothing.<br /><br />As I stood there with the wire in my hand, perplexed, my dog jumped on me.  ZAP!<br /><br />Aagh!<br /><br />Yelp!<br /><br />I had failed to take into considerationt he fact that my rubber shoes didn't gound me.  When the dog jumped on me she grounded us both, and we both got zapped.<br /><br />Getting shocked is unpleasant, more in an unnatural way than in a painful way.<br /><br />The fence was immediatly effective.  I think they each got shocked one more time and learned their lesson quick.  After three days I unplugged the Fido-Shock unit but kept the fence up.  The fence was a psychological deterrent and worked for years.<br /><br />Eventually my wife took the fence down and six month later the dogs were back to their old tricks.  My wife didn't let me set the fence back up, as she preferred dead plants to ""prison wire"" around the garden.<br /><br />Maybe 5 years later I set up a new garden in the back yard that the dogs loved to tromp around in.  I set the fence up and the dogs immediatly began ignoring it.  I don't think they ever got shocked.<br /><br />I left it plugged in for three days anyway (just in case) and have had it off ever since.<br /><br />Fido-Shock works great.  The disadvantages are that you can see the ""prison wire"" and stakes, and you might accidently shock yourself.",Great psychological as well as physical deterrent.
"summarize: It seems like there is a new ""Hottest Pepper in the World"" every couple of years or so.  Not too long ago it was the Red Savina® Habanero with a Scoville heat rating of 577,000 units.  Now it is the Naga Jolokia (also known as the Naga Morris, Nai Miris, Bih Jolokia and Bhut Jolokia, etc.) with a whopping 1,001,304  Scoville Heat Units according to the New Mexico State University Chile Pepper Institute. In February 2007, Guinness World Records certified the Bhut Jolokia (aka Naga Jolokia) as the hottest pepper in the world.  It is reportedly called the ""Ghost Pepper"" because after one bite of the pepper you ""give up the ghost"".<br /><br />Now Dave's Gourmet has made a sauce from this serious pepper.  This is nothing to fool around with, it will cause pain, a lot of pain.  So why would anybody want a sauce that hot (other than for bravado)?  I for one like the taste.  It is a little smokier that Habanero.  I also use it in sauces where I want heat but not the red color of chili peppers, such as a cream based sauce.  Since it only takes a drop to give me the heat that I want it will hardly change the color of a white sauce.<br /><br />My only reservations about it is that it contains hot pepper extract (which is what they call the stuff that they spray in the eyes of criminals).  I've seen hot pepper extract for sale as a commercial additive.  It's low on flavor but big on heat.  Was this added to give the sauce extra pain inducing heat while using fewer actual Jolokia peppers? I don't know but it makes you think.  Dave also has a special edition sauce that uses the Bhut Jolokia pepper and cost about four times more than this one does.  I like this sauce, but use with caution.",The Hottest of the Hot (for now)
"summarize: These bars are high in calories which is a good thing when hiking or performing some other strenuous exercise.  But they are not very high in flavor which is not such a good thing when eating them.  The bars are soft and have a brownie like texture.  The chocolate flavor is not pronounced, it is a dry cocoa flavor and texture.  Almond slivers are in the bars, there is a crunch every couple of bites, but the almond flavor is overpowered by the cocoa.  These are similar to other ""health"" bars in that they impart a chalky, dry texture.  No, my chocolate prayers were not answered by these bars.  The thing I liked about these is that they are not overly gooey and sweet.",All Natural but Taste Only OK
"summarize: I tried to feed my dog EVO red meat small bites because I wanted the best for him, but after a month it just had too much protein in it. He was gassy a lot and had soft stools. Sometimes even diarrhea. So I switched to this because Royal Canin also makes a special dog food for pugs. So in a couple of months when he's old enough I will switch him over to Pug 25. There are a couple of ingredients that I don't agree with like corn meal and beet pulp, the rest of the ingredients seem okay. After the switch to Royal Canin he is doing great. His stools firmed up and the gas was gone. He's happy and healthy and I'm happy with the food switch.",Great dog food. My pug is doing awesome.
"summarize: I purchased this based on reviews here on Amazon. Big Mistake!!! As soon as I received my shipment I went online to the Pamela's Products website and printed out recipes. So far I have tried 3 recipes and none of them have turned out even close to what they were supposed to be! I followed them to the letter and nada!<br /><br />First recipe was ""Cut Biscuits"". Turns out that their recipe for ""Drop Biscuits"" and ""Cut Biscuits"" is exactly the same and very runny. I decided to make ""Drop Biscuits"" instead because the batter was so runny and they didn't even rise. All I ended up with was some hard lumps on a cookie sheet that were dry.<br /><br />Next I printed the ""No Yeast By Hand Bread Loaf Recipe"". That didn't rise either and it came out the consistency of cornbread not like any kind of bread that you could actually make a grilled sandwich with or toast as the website claims.<br /><br />Ever the glutton for punishment, I decided to try the ""Bread Machine With Yeast Recipe"" from the website. I tried it twice on two different settings. First I tried the ""One Rise Rapid Cycle"" for gluten free bread and then I tried the ""Normal Cycle"" for white bread as the website says and they both ""fell"" (collapsed in the middle) shortly after the baking cycle started!!!<br /><br />I have now wasted money, eggs, olive oil, several yeast packets, time etc. and all I have to show for it is 4 1/2 bags of useless flour that isn't working with the recipes provided by the company that made it and I don't know how to use it for anything else. I had previously purchased products from ""Gluten Free Pantry"" and I never had any problems with their products.<br /><br />I only purchased this because of the reviews and because I could get it in bulk on Amazon for a better price. I will certainly be canceling my subscription for this product. Lesson learned, knowledge acquired...<br /><br />***Addendum: I decided to request a call from Amazon to let them know that the product may be defective because it was not performing correctly and to my surprise they offered me a full refund!!! I wasn't expecting that! And to think that I nearly decided to just let it go and chalk it up to experience. Thank God and Cheers to Amazon!!!",Didn't Live Up To The Hype...
"summarize: I got both the shampoo and the condition Clear Scalp. I have problems with itchy scalp, hair loss, and dry hair. When I first used this product, I noticed a difference in how my hair felt. It was super soft and I didn't notice that filmy feeling I have with other shampoos and conditioners. It was a nice change. A month later, I am still using both products. My scalp does feel better. My hair doesn't fall out as much (not sure if that is from my change of diet though or the shampoo), and my hair still feels soft. My sister purchased this product for colored hair and complained of build up. I have not noticed this. My hair still feels as soft as when I first used it.<br /><br />The bottles are also fairly easy to use. One opens from the top and the other from the bottom which is nice otherwise you can get the bottles mixed up (which on is the conditioner and which one is the shampoo).  You just press one side of the top and it opens up, press down and it snaps back in place. No mess. The shampoo and conditioner bottles look almost exactly alike, but like I said, they open differently.<br /><br />For the record, I have hair that goes past my shoulders and is thick and wavy. I've noticed my waves are more pronounced because they aren't dragging down from build up. I really like this shampoo and will continue to use them both.",Been using for over a month
"summarize: I love this product! I actually discovered it back in college as it was what my favorite coffee cart lady used in her ""white caps"". It is smooth and has a light flavor. It is sweet enough that you don't need any extra sugar and I like to add just a dash of cream, too. There is no such thing as real ""white chocolate"" so people who are expecting a heavy chocolate flavor might do best to stick with the regular brown stuff. No, it is not great for you, but I cannot imagine anyone that thinks most of the coffee drinks found in your favorite shops are ""good for you"". They are a treat and are meant to be enjoyed as such.",Being my own barista is so much better!
"summarize: My dogs LOVE these treats.  They're soft, chewy, smell wonderful, they're low cal and seem to be a very healthy choice compared to a lot of other dog treats on the market.  I break them in half and use them during dog training class.  I give the product itself 5 stars.  But overall I'm only giving a 3-star rating because I ordered 6 packs of these treats in mid-Oct, shipped via two day shipping, and three of the six packages expire at the end of Oct.  Very disappointed with the vendor who fulfilled this order.  Definitely will NOT order from this store ever again.",Great product but beware expiration date
"summarize: Oh my goodness...I have an 11 year old pug/beagle mix that has been lethargic for about 3 years, wouldn't really play, had a dull coat no matter how much I groomed her, and has had itchy paws and armpits for a long time. I never knew that all of that crap was in the big name brand dog foods. I had always had her on Purina of some sort until I started doing research. I was blown away by what I read and quickly became obsessed with finding a better food without paying an arm and a leg. I refuse to pay more for my dogs food than for our own food. After researching about 30 different dog foods and prices and brands on different websites, I went with Canidae All Life Stages (chicken, turkey, lamb, and fish)via Amazon with free super saver shipping for both my 11 year old Puggle and my new 10 week old labrador retriever puppy. I haven't regretted the change or the purchase at all! I am absolutely thrilled. My 11 year old isn't nearly as itchy, has a crazy shiny coat now, and has ALL KINDS of energy to keep up with the puppy now! Also, the breeder of my new lab had her on Purina Pro Plan Large Breed so I switched her right away and even her coat looks so much better now and it's only been about 3 weeks. I can't wait to see the difference in the two of them over the next 3 or 4 months. They both did get a little bit constipated during the transition period from their old foods to the Canidae, but a little bit of canola oil for a few days drizzled over their breakfast and dinner fixed that until their bodies adjusted. Both are regular now with no problems. Also, during the transition, I couldn't get either of them to eat even one piece of their old food. They would both pick out the Canidae and gobble it up and then leave their old food in the bowl until they were later famished! It was funny to watch!  Great product, great service, and will definitely continue to order the 44 lb bag via Amazon. The packaging was very very poor but that's a different issue. The box that the food was shipped in wasn't even big enough for the bag and the UPS driver brought me the food, with pieces of the box laying on top of the bag. Oh well, I'm still thrilled with the product!<br /><br />UPDATE:  SEVERAL MONTHS LATER, BOTH DOGS ARE STILL DOING FANTASTIC WITH THE CANIDAE FOOD! THE PUPPY'S COAT ACTUALLY SPARKLES LIKE I PUT GLITTER ON HER IN THE SUNLIGHT, IT'S CRAZY. THE PUGGLE IS ONLY SHEDDING A THIRD OF WHAT SHE USED TO AND THE ONLY THING THAT SHE EVER CHEWS ON IS ONE OF HER PAWS AND THE VET GAVE ME A SPRAY FOR THAT. I AM STILL THRILLED WITH THE FOOD AND WITH AMAZON'S PRICE AND THE FREE SHIPPING!",I have a brand new dog!!
"summarize: Before we switched to eating low carb, we used to LOVE a nice big bag of chips.  I was missing those zesty salty crunchy snacks, until we found these delicious almonds!  I have tried all of the flavors and love them all, but these are my current favorite.  I like the snack size packs as a reminder that I have had enough since I can never stop eating them (just like potato chips, no one can eat just one).  A whole package is only  8 grams of carbs (only 4 grams of net carbs if you are an Atkins dieter).  These almonds have a nice crisp texture (even better if you put them in the refrigerator for a bit) and the seasoning is evenly distributed.  Not to strong, but also not too weak that it gets lost on the almonds. A package of 12 only lasted about a week in our home, back to order more.",Great Low Carb snack to go!!
"summarize: Although I wish the ""ingredients"" label would tell us what the ""spices"" are.<br /><br />I liked the zestiness imparted by this product, although something in it was a bit too spicy-hot for my palate, and in more than one case (marinade, and spaghetti sauce) I found that I had to add sugar (honey can be used too) to cut down on the excess piquancy.<br /><br />As a salad dressing, it imparts a nice ooomph. As a marinade to chicken it can be a bit overpowering (which is why I added the sugar).<br /><br />Although I haven't done so yet, it might be a very nice surprise ingredient to a quickbread or a flatbread.<br /><br />I used Olive oil or canola oil, and apple cider vinegar, when mixing up the marinade and/or the salad dressing.<br /><br />The lower sodium content is a big plus too.",A nice combination of taste-bud teasers
"summarize: Just made these last night.  (I used rice milk for the milk and wet flax meal in place of the eggs.)  I was expecting it to easily crack apart and be heavy and grainy like just about everything else I've made (bread, cookies, brownies, etc.) but it pulled apart like ""real"" bread!  They were also quite tasty.  Even my husband (who doesn't do GF/DF) agreed not only were they not bad, they were pretty good.  We used a little seasoned tomato sauce for dipping the bread, and it was great.  This is definitely going in to standard rotation.<br /><br />Prep took longer than I was expecting as the dough was not nearly wet and pliable enough from the amount of liquid I added at the begining, per the recipe.  Perhaps that was because of my flax sub.  Tapioca flour is lighter than air, and when I went to mix the initial liquid ingredients, it practically disappeared in there, and it seemed like all I was doing was mixing dry flour that danced out of the bowl and on to my shirt and counter.  It DID state to keep adding liquid a tsp. at a time until it formed soft dough - it just seemed to take quite a  bit more little additions of milk until I was able to make it all stick together.  It took some time to go from a bag of powder to something I could actually ball up, but it did happen and it was very good.",Best GF DF bread item I've made so far
"summarize: I am for the most part a health nut.  I am always looking for very healthy food, that is also convenient.  Taste unfortunately has to take a lower priority, and I generally expect to pay more ('you get what you pay for' even applies to food and health; low quality food = low quality health).  I consider this product to satisfy all overall fairly well.  The taste is good considering it is raw and wholesome, however, taste is subjective, you may not agree.  It can be a bit hard, so when I can, I put it in a bowl and soak it in a little water for a few minutes and eat it like cereal.  I think it takes better that way too.<br />Lastly, we'd all like everything cheaper including this product, but I at least like the extra discount I get from the subscribe and save.  It makes a difference.","Wholesome Product, Convenient, Good Taste, OK Price."
"summarize: I love Pop Tarts. There's tons of different ways to eat them. Unfortunately they aren't the lowest calorie food item out there, so I decided to pick up the low fat variety & try them. After eating them, I was slightly disappointed after doing some fact checking.<br /><br />Taste-wise, these things are awesome & taste very similar to the regular product. Calorie-wise, there isn't a humongous amount of difference. With the regular pop tarts, there was only a difference of 12 calories. The fat content *is* halved in this set, but the sodium, sugar & carbohydrate levels are substantially higher in this than in the regular version.<br /><br />Bluntly put, you'd be better off diet-wise to go with the normal poptarts than to go for this option. If all you are worried about is the fat content, you are set. If you are looking at a variety of factors, you'd be better off going for the regular version. I'm giving this product 3 stars for the taste, but I took 2 away because of the other factors.","Good taste, but for diet purposes I'd look elsewhere"
"summarize: I initially hated this coffee, until I learned that the problem wasn't the coffee but my brewing technique.  This isn't a great coffee, but it can be a reasonably good coffee if you brew it right.  My problem was that initially I was not brewing it correctly.<br /><br />I'm still not using fancy coffee grinding or brewing equipment, but now I follow brewing guidelines that you can get on any good coffee lover website, including brewing at the right temperature, preheating the cup and filter holder, rinsing the filter, and pouring water into the ground coffee in the right way.<br /><br />I use a Melitta style drip filter.  I have a Bodum French Press that improves the taste even more, but I choose to use a paper filter because studies have indicated that paper filters eliminate most of the components in coffee that raise LDL and hence cholesterol (look up ""Health effects of coffee"" in Wikipedia for more info).<br /><br />I keep the beans in a half dozen baggies in the freezer and just remove them from the freezer as I need them.<br /><br />One thing I learned from my brewing experiments is that brewing technique may help a mediocre coffee more than a really good coffee.  Using my former poor brewing techniques, Camano Island Sumatra tasted terrible but Peet's Sumatra and Starbucks Sumatra both tasted good (though the Starbucks had more variation in quality).  Improving my brewing technique made the Peets somewhat better but improved the Camano Island Sumatra dramatically.  I haven't tried the Starbucks since changing my brewing technique, so I can't report on that.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great coffee, this isn't it, but if you're looking for a decent-tasting inexpensive Sumatra and are willing to use standard recommended brewing techniques, Camano Island Sumatra can be a good choice.",Good if you brew it right
"summarize: After gastric bypass surgery, you have to eat 50 or more grams of protein EVERY DAY. Sugar-free Protein shakes give you most of it. But you do like to get it from other sources also. You have a very small 1/8-1/4 cup stomach so you can't waste your space on snacks that can't benefit you with vitamins, proteins or some nutrient of value.

"summarize: I bought this four-pack last week and it arrived in a box that was smaller in one dimension than the mustard tins within. The box was shorter than the tins by such a large margin that the box top bulged open. By the time the package arrived at the house, two of the four tins had been crushed. There was mustard powder all over the inner plastic bag.<br />I called Amazon and they shipped a replacement immediately, overnight, for free.

"summarize: After having tried this Oolong style tea in a friends Chinese restaurant (which was her personal stock) I set out to try to purchase something similar.  My friend is from Fuzhou, PRC and her family works in the tea industry there.  The product she gave me to drink was lighter or more delicate tasting in flavor or quality.  This product is not all that smooth and mediocre when compared to the type she had.  This product did maintain that characteristic good Monkey Picked Oolong Teas of never becoming more bold in taste as the tea steeps longer all the way through your drinking experience. Preparing the tea in your YiXing teapot chinese style will improve your experience and  is better than typically American style brewing. It seems priced close to some of the offerings on the net.  I will not fault the service of the company.  This product is slightly less refined than some picks.","Finest Supreme Monkey Picked Oolong Tea ........ or just OK, to mediocre."
"summarize: First ... this is one of the Fancy Feast dinners my cats like. And I appreciate the fact that I can identify the ingredients visually.<br />Printed here is the list of ingredients, finally in type I can read without a magnifying glass. I did not know they add sodium nitrate, which is carcinogenic. I have had three of my cats over the years die of cancer. Most of the tumors were in the stomach.<br />I can see that the food looks like food, and it is acceptable regardless of how ""red"" it looks. To add sodium nitrate to a catfood, when the cats only care about the smell and condition, is simply endangering the life of a pet. Animals have difficulty enough. I still buy this, but not very often. At least it does not have animal or fish byproducts. But I will add an anti-angiogenesis product to their diet in hopes it will counteract the nitrates, at least until I can either find a product I can trust or start cooking for them myself.","Cats like it but don't ""see"" the sodium nitrate."
"summarize: Reading the reviews reveals everybody likes something different in their Chai tea lattes.  I, too, was a regular at Starbucks, until I found out how many calories each one of those lattes was costing me!  For those who don't like Splenda, I can understand why you might be a bit concerned about that sweetener being used in this drink, however, Splenda is one of the few sweeteners that hasn't been found to be harmful to one's health.<br /><br />The biggest benefit to drinking the chai tea latte (IMO) is the fact that it's only 7 grams of carbs and 80 calories per serving!  You can't beat that.  It is a bit sweet, however, they make 'em that way at Starbucks too, and it definitely satisfies my sweet tooth.  I will definitely be ordering this tea again when my current two packages run out!","Low Calorie, Low Carb, Great Taste!"
"summarize: I try to buy organic products whenever possible; so I decided to try this. I usually do not use milk quickly enough to justify buying a gallon of fresh milk; so this sounded good. I cannot find it in any of the stores in my area and Amazon is easy to deal with so this seemed like a good choice. Organic Valley should be a bit more forthcoming with specifics about this product; since many of us may not be familiar with it. I have used a lot of other nonfat dry milk products, but this is quite different. Although the actual product description does not state that it is ""non-instant"", if you enlarge the picture, you can just barely read it on the front of the package. The mixing instructions on the package tell you that you can stir or shake to mix the milk, but your blender or an electric mixer are probably your best options. Stirring produces a very lumpy, undissolved mess. I called Organic Valley and spoke with a very complacent woman who informed me that she puts the dry milk and water in a jar and shakes it vigorously to mix it. She also informed me that since it is not an instant product, once it is mixed, you will need to stir or shake it again if it is not used immediately; because the mix will begin to settle.

I have no problem with the flavor, overall, but some definitely taste better than others. Of all that I've tried, the meatloaf is my least favorite. The texture and smell kinda remind me of canned dog food. Seriously.<br />Otherwise...<br />I'd recommend the chicken and stuffing, chicken and mashed potatoes, turkey and stuffing, beef tips and potatoes. Those are all pretty good.<br />As for the comments about the potatoes being hard... this is true, but I think the reason is so that once they are heated with the gravy, you can mash them up with a fork without them ending up too runny.",Tastes okay... but definitely doesn't taste like meatloaf
"summarize: These little pretzel pieces are totally addictive, which is probably not a good thing because they're a lot worse for you than you'd think pretzels should be. They have around 60 fat calories and 3 grams of saturated fat in ONE ounce, which equals out to be 15% of your daily sat fat intake per serving (one ounce).<br />The reason they're so good AND so fatty is that the mustard/onion seasoning is in an oil that permeates through the shell of the pretzel, making them extra flavorful and not dry at all. They're a little sweet, have good mustard flavor, and the onion flavor even comes through a little (they taste like they're supposed to). I try to just grab a handful at snack time and quit while I'm ahead, but I usually end up going back for more later.<br />If you're willing to put up with a little extra fat for a lot of extra flavor, these are a perfect snack.","These are awesome, fatty, and flavorful."
"summarize: I was looking for something sugar free but did not know that there was something out there that did not have aspartame or other synthetic poison in it.  This has erythritol in it, a sugar alcohol, with 0 calories and no effect on your glucose level.  The flavor is not sweet, but the texture of this candy is just right for when I need a chewy nutty treat that won't effect my insulin level.  I am excited to have found this and the erythritol.  I have read about erythritol and feel it is safe,and have purchased it as well.  Try this turtle candy.  Won't make you sick, and helps you not feel so left out when everyone else has a treat.  I hope amazon starts carrying it soon.",excellent sugarfree candy w/o any aspartame
"summarize: I love trying different turkey (meat) balls made with fat free ground turkey. I created my own recipes for Scandinavian and Italian. No one believes they are eating turkey and they love them! Costco sells a four pack by a well known brand name, 98% fat free. I am not sure of the exact weight of two packages but it is approximately three pounds. I used two boxes of this wonderful coating (mixed in with everything else) two eggs, some water and some cooked brown rice for a healthy filler. I always leave the meat very moist so the end result is not dry. I made two test turkey balls, fried with no fat using a non stick frying pan. I turned the meat balls so all sides were lightly browned and very crispy. The taste was extremely pleasant, mildly spicy. I like very spicy so I added some ground red pepper and garlic powder because I did not have hot Cajun pepper. I just ordered some as well as more of the Luzianne chicken coating.<br /><br />The result was wonderful and I froze a substantial amount of the Luzianne turkey meatballs. I am extremely pleased and so is my family. I believe you will like this mix regardless of how you choose to use it!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H25SQW"">Luzianne Chicken Coating Mix, 8 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>",Great Cajun and here is an interesting twist!

They are a bit pricey but the quality if worth the price.<br /><br />The pita chips have a delicate whole grain flavor that is very satisfying.<br /><br />I especially like that the chips are whole rather than cracked into small pieces.<br /><br />There are 11 very crispy servings per box with 120 cal per serving, 3 g fat, 180 mg sodium, 22 g carbs, 5 g fiber, 2 g sugar, and 3 g protein.<br /><br />The chips are made from whole grain oats, rye, brown rice, barley, buckweat, sesame seeds, yellow corn meal, millet, cane juice, and sea salt.<br /><br />They are made by Kashi, La Jolla, CA--made in the USA.<br /><br />These pita chips make me want to give other Kashi product a second chance.<br /><br />I am definitely going to try their other pita chip flavors zesty salsa!",Kashi 7 Grain Sea Salt Pita Chips 7.9 oz.
"summarize: Review Update: 5/2/2012: Culinary Elite brand black garlic on Amazon is a better value than this one is now. You get 2.2 oz for $6.75 on Amazon and their shipping is cheaper and it comes peeled so you are not paying for the majority of the weight in stuff you throw out like the core and peels. You wind up getting twice as much black garlic for half the price by ordering Culinary Elite. This one is good too but it is unpeeled and comes in a bag rather than a  tub and the weight you pay for includes the cores and the peels and the stems in this brand.  I liked it, but Culinary Elite is a better value.<br /><br />Black garlic is super soft so it's very difficult to peel if you buy it unpeeled. No matter what brand you get, I suggest buying peeled only. It's a mess to peel and gets all under your nails if it's really fresh black garlic.<br /><br />Original review:<br />---------------------<br /><br />Black garlic may sound odd but one bite and you'll be an addict.<br /><br />You may have seen it on cooking shows by elite chefs; it's not easy to find unless you are in a very nice restaurant...or my kitchen. Because I'm a huge fan. And now, apparently, on Amazon too.<br /><br />Used in China for quite some time, it is used originally as a homeopathic cancer fighter due to it's richness in antioxidants and fighter of free radicals.<br /><br />But one taste and you'll be in heaven.<br /><br />It takes over a month to make one clove. Why? It is heated the ENTIRE time in a high humidity low temperature oven.  This acts like a balsamic vinegar reduction where you start with something a bit bitter and end up with something rich and sweet...in fact, it tastes much like a balsamic vinegar reduction/garlic fusion.<br /><br />Unlike regular garlic that exudes from your pores and is bitter, this is smooth and doesn't hang around long or emit a pore smell either! You can date and eat it! Woo Hoo! But it's so tender and sweet you can literally pop a clove in your mouth and chew and not grimace.  It's slightly jelly like and can be easily mixed in ANYTHING to make it better. I love it on pizza, in pasta, in green beans, mashed potatoes...my dad puts it on all steaks now.<br /><br />You can literally put a lot in anything and it wakes up the flavor beautifully and wonderfully...<br /><br />It is not mixed with anything...just pure garlic, cooked slowly for an exceptionally long time to make it rich, smooth, and molasses-like sweet.",gourmet garlic even if you thought you hated garlic
"summarize: My dogs love these!  They are huge compared to other ""large"" antlers and much cheaper if you calculate the price per Oz of the other antlers I purchased at PetCo.<br /><br />I have an aggressive chewer ""10 yr old yellow lab"" and will go through a large rawhide bone in about an hour or an X-large ""everlasting dog treat"" in about 30 minutes.  I also have a moderate chewer ""2 yr old golden retrieve"" who goes through the rawhide and ""everlasting dog treat"" in about twice the time as the lab.<br /><br />Both of my dogs work on these antlers almost daily.  We purchased two of Newts Chews Antler ""Monster"" size back in August and it's now October.  One of the chews is half it's original length and the other is about three quarters of it's original length.  The dogs seem to only chew on one end or the other and wear it down from the end.  There have not been any pieces break off that can be swallowed and cause a bowel obstruction, unlike rawhide.  They don't get all  gooie (is that a word?) and smelly like other treats we have tried.  Our dogs are mostly indoors so we need something that is safe, non-staining, non-smelly, durable, and cost effective.  This surly fits the bill.<br /><br />After trying all types of ""indestructible"", ""long lasting"", etc. dog treats.  These antlers are our favorite.",My dogs love these!  They are huge...
"summarize: I purchased the Miracle Noodle Spinach angel hair pasta.  I looked at many of the reviews prior to making my first bag.  I did find that they have a strong fish odor upon opening.  This was expected.  I rinsed the noodles under cole water for 4-5 minutes.  The odor decreased significantly.  I boiled the noodles for about 7 minutes then rinsed under cold water.  While boiling, I added a dry garlic rub so that the noodles may take in some of the flavor.  After boiling, I rinsed the noodles under cold water for 30 seconds or so.  To finish, I added about 1-1.5 teaspoons of garlic cooking creme, red pesto with truffles, and a touch of basil garlic parmasean dipping oil.  I warmed the noodle-sauce mixture for about 5-10 minutes.  I admit, the noodle texture was interesting...I guess it was like an al dente ramen noodle.  I wasn't expecting a spaghetti noodle though.  I would definitely make again.","Not Bad, Not Bad At All"
"summarize: The flavor is almost entirely ginger.  It is barely sweetened and not at all lemony.  I really liked it but I don't think the rest of my family would.  The others would have put a couple of spoons of sugar and a big squeeze of lemon in it. (they like ginger-flavored hot lemonade.)<br />The flavor is much the same as slicing a couple of quarter sized slices of ginger into a cup, adding hot water, and mashing it a bit.  Then add one of those tiny scoops of stevia, or a few drops of stevia extract.<br />This product is a nice alternative for when you don't room in your pocket for ginger root and a knife. Honestly I will probably buy some for sick days.  I lived in Cambodia and the grocery shelves were always stocked with at least 6 brands of ginger drink so I do have an appropriate background to judge.  This product is at least equal to the best of them.<br /><br />Unfortunately it was not a very satisfactory trial. We were sent only one packet from the box, so there was no listing of ingredients or nutritional information.  So I can't say how many carbs and how much sugar is included.  Yes, honey is nice but honey is made of sugar, sugar, and sugar.  Many of us really need to know how much.<br /><br /> I also have to vent, and this is probably not the company that produced it, but an Amazon employee - the single packet, the size of a tea bag, was sent in a 12x18x6 inch cardboard box with six yards of bubble wrap.  Shame.",I am a ginger fanatic and I liked this.

"summarize: I have purchased 3 bags of Taste of the Wild Bison and Venison. I had 2 Standard Poodle when I purchased the first bag. My 5 yr old SP is notoriously picky and has a very sensitive stomach. She LOVED this food. We went through the first bag and both were doing great. (Gaining weight which is very hard for her to do). So I ordered a second bag, exactly the same. They ate almost all of it over several weeks and all was fine. With the last several cups in the food container the 1 year old SP became violently ill like she has never been before. The older one then became sick. I figured they had gotten into some thing outside and reordered. The 3rd bag came several days later, both had recovered completely by this time. We also got a Bichon Frise puppy about a week before this. The older dogs had Taste of the Wild late in the afternoon and the puppy grabbed some they had spilled on the floor. All 3 dogs then became ill, throwing up all night. Immediately the next morning I removed all Taste of the Wild from the house and put them all on puppy food. Everything cleared up. I have called customer service and was told their vet would be calling me. That was several days ago. I have now emailed requesting a refund.","First bag went really well, 2nd and 3rd made all 3 dogs violently ill"
"summarize: I am really REALLY happy with this flour!  i started baking routinely (again) a few years ago when Amazon offered an exceptional deal on a bread machine (something I thought I'd never buy); but it did make it easier to bake while working....(adding one more thing to an already crowded week).  After seeing the nearly ubiquitous ""no-knead"" recipe I went back to doing it by hand.  However, while that looked like ""artisan bread,"" it was basically commercial white but in a different shape: garbage in- garbage out as they say in tech circles.  If you are using bleached white flour and commercial yeast, what you get is commercial white bread (albeit without the preservatives and other junk mass manufacturers add).  I'll note, for those of you who have stumbled on that recipe, it is a 200 year old recipe;, essentially sourdough, but made without either the wild yeast or fermentation (which gives sourdough its flavor).  All that said, having discovered that I began my own (wild yeast sourdough) cultures and now have half a dozen around my kitchen (which is starting to look like a lab.  In the past year I have made something on the order of 100 loaves of bread, and despite many tweaks, it was never quite there (not as good as I had hoped).  This flour made the difference~  For the first time I turned out a loaf of bread as good as any I have had~  You may not notice as much of a difference if you are using commercial yeast (though I expect there will still be some), however.... it made a HUGE difference with my sourdough cultures.  The bleaching and processing in most flour knocks out the natural yeasts.  This flour really took off~ My loaves were roughly 1/3 larger than any I had made before as the yeasts were more active and the rise better.  I hope Amazon keeps carrying this as it made a bigger difference than any other thing I have done.  (I would, however, recommend the addition of an oven stone <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000E1FDA"">Old Stone Oven 4467 14-Inch by 16-Inch Baking Stone</a> (for example) if you do not already have one,which added more to the quality, as kitchen gear goes, than anything else.  However, nothing matters more than what you put in it.  This flour is visibly different; a different color (unbleached, looks almost like graham flour) and texture (stone ground flour leaves more of the germ intact).<br /><br />I came to Amazon looking for this after reading <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0688092616"">Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands</a> widely hailed as the bible of artisan bread.  She recommended stone ground flour (in fact, it was specified in all of the recipes).  Before I tried this, I would not have believed what a difference it would make!  I am sure there are other good stone ground flours out there, but... I am very happy with this and will absolutely stick with it as long as Amazon carries it!<br />Beyond the quality, I like that there 9s variety. (I usually buy 20-50 lb. bags of bread flour).  It is nice to have variety.  Although it has been mentioned before, the variety I received included unbleached bread flour, whole wheat bread flour, pastry flour and corn meal.  I have only used the 2 bread flours so far, nut am happy enough with them that I am going to up my subscription (and stop buying those large sacks of white flour).  Even though I mixed them (adding whole grains...this is very much better, so much so that my 14 year old broke into the second loaf while I was out of the house.

"summarize: If you suffer from blood sugar issues and tend to get dizzy, shaky and sweaty if you don't eat I recommend this bar. It doesn't taste fantastic but it will help regulate your blood sugar and keep you from crashing. I keep a few around me most of the time, so if I don't have a chance to eat I don't go all crazy.<br /><br />I personally don't get blood sugar crashes if I exercise a few hours before I should eat.<br /><br />If I eat it during a crash, I feel kinda yucky and low energy, but the shakes etc go away.","Tastes like peanut butter sawdust, but I love it"
"summarize: I love the health benefits of Quinoa.  As a vegetarian, I don't get very many complete sources of protein with easy access.  Quinoa delivers that.  But I keep forgetting to cook quinoa instead of rice with meals.  This is where quinoa flour comes in handy.  I make a lot of breads - Indian flatbreads among them.  I add quinoa to any bread recipe - substitute up to a quarter of the gluten flour, whether it's wheat or something else, with quinoa and you will not be able to tell the difference in taste or texture.  It comes out looking a little whiter than if you were to use whole grain wheat for example.  The taste is excellent.  I have also used this as a base for when I am cooking roux or creamy soups.  Turns out great!<br />We got the subscription from Amazon Prime so we wouldn't have to remember to order it - it shows up exactly when we are ready for more.",Great Flavor!  Good for You!

"summarize: This is my second purchase of Amoretti Honeydew Melon syrup. Their customer service is above and beyond, I would not hesitate to do business with them again. The Honeydew Melon syrup is of very high quality and has a nice vescocity to, it is not watered down like many other brands. It has a crisp, clean taste and works perfectly to make Starbucks Green Tea Frapps at home! We love this stuff and will surely be purchasing more through Amoretti when needed. If you are wondering if it is worth your purchase, no need to worry as it is truly worth the nominal price they charge. It comes wonderfully packaged in a nice clear box with it's own pump for easy dispensing. The bottle itself is very attractive, and it is all well wrapped to ensure safety during shipping. All I can say is everything all around is high quality from this company. They do not scimp on their products or their desire to provide the best customer service.","Highest quality syrup around, makes excellent SB Green Tea Frapps!!"
"summarize: For the record, I'm in Austin.  I have long hair, and a lot of my clothing does not involve synthetic fibers.  Having prepared some of this for dinner, I am drinking organic, fair-trade coffee with gluten-free almond milk and agave nectar, as I write this.<br /><br />But, mmm...no.<br /><br />See here is the thing.  This is mung beans, sprouted lentils, and quinoa.  It's also ""Bragg's Amino Acids"" and a spice mixture that doesn't say ""gluten-free"" on the label.<br /><br />As for taste, this isn't ideal:<br /><br />Bragg's is a very acquired taste.  Even after a decade of being vegetarian and thirteen years of being gluten-free after that, I still don't like the stuff--and unless you're sure that your recipient thinks it's good stuff, you're going to get an ""eeewww"" on your Hanukah or Christmas present.<br /><br />This is also a gluten-free fail:<br /><br />The quinoa, mung beans and sprouted lentils are all good, and it's merciful that they are marked gluten-free, because sometimes it's difficult to know how things are processed, and if they are gluten-free.  But, then the spice mixture doesn't say it's gluten-free--which means it's probably not, and that's kind of annoying.<br /><br />Even drinking my fair-trade coffee out of an Ikea mug, I'm still a little stumped as to who would think this is just nifty.  I felt sacrilegious adding canned spinach to the first cooking attempt--the enclosed recipes call for things like cilantro, which is not something one tends to have sitting around the house in the dead of winter, even in Austin.<br /><br />So, it's good food, but it fails as to practicality and gluten-freeness. I'm wondering if the Austin Food Bank would find a good use for it.","Maybe a Little Too Earthy, Even for the Crunchy and Gluten-Free"
"summarize: I must agree with the few people who complained that this dvd was lacking in special features and whatnot. However, if you have never seen the movie at all, or enjoyed the movie but do not already have a copy, it's still a good buy. It's a great movie, no matter how it's presented on the dvd, and you do get a few episodes of the cartoon as well. I watched Beetlejuice as a kid, both the movie and the cartoons, so I probably would've bought it even if it was a poorly recorded VHS :) In short, don't expect it to be ""deluxe"", but I definitely recommend buying it (unless you already have a standard version of it).<br /><br />As for the movie itself, if you've never seen it, it's basically a ghost story that is purposely presented in a cheesy manner to be funny. If you're familiar with Tim Burton at all, you'll know he tends to stray from the norm. Don't expect to be scared; that's not what this movie is about. It's basically about a nice couple of ghosts who try to scare away the family who lives in their house, but the family isn't scared; in fact, they invite other people over and try to show off the ghosts - so the ghost couple hires a... rather disgusting guy to help them out, and things pretty much go downhill from there. Definitely and old 80s classic.","Awesome movie, not very ""deluxe"" dvd"
"summarize: The coffee leaves a bitter aftertaste and I always have to brush my teeth after drinking this coffee. This is the first KCup that I've ever tried that is decaf, but I don't recommend. I always get a headache after drinking this, but continue to drink it just because I don't want to take a loss. If I run out of my regular flavors, I have this as a backup. Before writing this review, I've decided to throw the rest out. My suggestion is to try a flavored coffee, because the caffeine content isn't as high as the other full bodied coffees. As another reviewer mentioned this coffee has methylene chloride which may be the reason I get those headaches. Try at your own risk.

"summarize: I was a loyal customer of this product for over four years.  It WAS the best pizza crust by far!!!  BUT, they reduced the amount of mix per pizza.  Used to use 2.25 cups of flower for a 14"" pizza.  Now, they want you to use 1.25.  It is terrible now.  You have to reduce the amount of water that they recommend in order to get a crust that is not too watery.  I am very disappointed. I am not a celiac, but my wife is.  I enjoyed this pizza crust even more than regular wheat flour crusts.  But, no longer.  Namaste, raise the price on your product.

"summarize: My children and husband and I LOVE nuts! I was worried these would be too strong for the children, but the 6 year old liked it, but didn't want another. The 4 year old ate an entire handful, and said he'd like more, but only with water, and the 3 year old ate about ten before she said, ""These are REALLY pepper-ish!""<br /><br />I really enjoyed the strong taste - reminded me of beef jerky or something. But I could only eat a few - the taste is QUITE strong, but a very good taste! So, if you'd like some nuts that will hang around the house for a few days, these are great! Very fresh, good texture, and delicious, and you can't down the entire box in one sitting for sure.<br /><br />Sra. Gose<br />Author of Spanish Fun Activity Calendar","Very tasty, a few at a time."
"summarize: I refrigerated the cans as soon as they arrived as I prefer chilled juice beverages. Upon opening the can, I noticed a release of gas. The details on the can indicate there is sparkling water, aka carbonated water much like soda. Rather than being a pure pomegranate juice drink, there is a mix of other juices: apple, white grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry, and pomegranate. I could easily detect the cranberry and apple, followed by grape and lemon. The pineapple and pomegranate was extremely subtle. The drink is far from being sweet and tastes much like apple/cranberry juice. My only complaint is that the cans are rather small. If they were 12 ounce cans or of larger volume, I would have enjoyed it for a longer period of time. The Izze Pomegranate juice is advertised to not contain any refined sugars, caffeine, or preservatives. Overall, this is the perfect chilled beverage for relaxing outside during the summer.","Tarty juice drink, great for the summer."
"summarize: I'm not a member of the food police. However; I get really mad when a company short changes their customers hoping they will not notice. ESPECIALLY a supposed higher end ""GOURMET"" producer like Ghirardelli!<br /><br />The quick and dirty for those who don't want to read my detailed review.<br /><br />**Is it better than ""Swiss Miss,"" YES.<br /><br />**Did it used to be better before they over-sweetened, cut the # of servings from 20 to 12 and generally ruined a decent product?

Probably.<br /><br />**Do I still recommend Ghirardelli Hot Chocolates. NOPE Not Any More. (want to know why? read on)<br /><br />For years I have enjoyed the Ghirardelli line of hot chocolates. That is about to change!<br /><br />NOTE: Until this year they have born the subtitle ""Old Fashioned."" That designation has been dropped for reasons which will soon become apparent. They have also quite conspicuously dropped the Product Satisfaction Guarantee along with the Ghirardelli address for applying for reimbursement if you the consumer were dissatisfied. Does this bode well for us? You be the judge and by all means let Ghirardelli know. I cannot include the address due to Amazon review policies. You may however contact them by email at their website.<br /><br />Something I strongly encourage. As a hot chocolate lover I want the original recipie back. I hope after reading my review you will too.<br /><br />What is Ghirardelli doing? Quite simply boosting the sugar levels to astronomical levels and engaging in what I call ""shorting.""<br /><br />Before a serving of any Ghirardelli hot chocolate mix consisted of (3) Tbsp., (22g) yielding twenty, (20) servings per 16oz. can.<br /><br />NOW one serving is (4) Tbsp., (39 grams) yielding only TWELVE (12) servings for the same 16oz. can. This gives us 40 percent LESS servings per can. And at an average of $5.50 per can less s&h an increase from 27.5 cents/serving to 45.8 cents/serving. -- Some may say this is gourmet hot chocolate why quarrel over a few cents. Fair question, but lets be sure were talking about chocolate and not cheap fillers.<br /><br />I have a few cans still left from the ""Old Fashioned"" style which is what Ghirardelli has marketed for years. It IS different and I can taste the difference. However, I will post both Nutrition labels side by side for you to compare and add my analysis at the end. Hopefully the facts will be as clear to you as they are me.<br /><br />NOTE: the nutrition label is a requirement of the USDA. Further they are reprinted everywhere so I am assuming that this is PUBLIC DOMAIN information.

To my taste the NEW formula is much too sweet!<br /><br />The Nutrition label bears out my biggest gripes with this REFORMULATED product:<br /><br />  (1) It was sweet before. Now by UPPING the SUGAR so dramatically and adding salt as a sugar booster I no longer like it.<br /><br />  (2) Not enough fat and other ingredients were added to convince me that any REAL gains in CHOCOLATE were made.<br /><br />  ## The TASTE of the new formula bears this out. (I have taken to cutting the serving size and adding Cocoa powder to get more Chocolate and less sugar.<br /><br />  (3) I DESPISE the shorting (Pumping it full of sugar and Cutting the servings by almost HALF.)<br /><br />  (4) And the price stays the same for less. That really frosts my goblet<br /><br />I can no longer recommend this product.<br /><br />Ghirardelli You had a decent thing going and you blew it.<br /><br />PERSONALLY, I'm forwarding this review to the company and since Hot chocolate is just that. I'm going to experiment making either a home-made ganache syrup (melted chocolate & cream) or trying to find a way to finely grate or powder high quality chocolate to make my own brand. That's Really All The Old Style Was. Hot ""Chocolate"" not Cocoa.  I'm sure for people with way too much money there are Hot chocolates available through boutiques where price is no object or... it IS the object. I'm not that rich. Besides if I come up with a home version that curls your toes then I may go into business myself or just enjoy it with a few friends.",New Recipie: Less servings More Sugar Not recommended (I used to)
"summarize: Even though you don't really save any money by buying this soup through Amazon, it's still nice to have it on hand when you don't feel like cooking or want something tasty on a chilly day.  Also, I use this soup as a base and add other ingredients to it to make it even more hearty.  It tastes good straight out of the can and if you add a salad, it's enough for a complete meal.  I wish it was possible to mix up the case with other flavors, but I like this soup well enough that I don't mind buying an entire case.  It usually lasts me all winter.",Very Tasty Soup for Chilly Days!
"summarize: As far as Chia seeds go, you can hop between brands here on amazon and they all taste the same. Sure there are people who complain about a bag bag or what not, but I am sure those are few and far between. 3 pounds for under $25 which if you take a serving almost everyday will last your almost 3 months (~70 servings). I am assuming if you are looking a Chia seeds you already know the health benefits. Healthy fats, No net-cars (all fiber), and a good source of protein, potassium, calcium and iron. Enough said there. But do they taste good? If you just eat a spoonful of them the answer is no. Its like chewing on just about any other grain in the raw. There are several ways to enjoy them, meaning they actually enhance a dish. I personally use them in yogurt. I feel it adds a texture to yogurt not identical but similar to granola. People also frequently add them to oatmeal, salads, soups and protein shakes to name a few. You will notice a trend in that they work well in mixtures.<br />Only complaints I have is the pre-cut tear-off on the bag is useless, but I own a pair a scissors so the problem lasted about 2 seconds. The bag does come with a Ziploc like top that has worked just fine for me.<br />Overall five stars. If you are looking for Chia Seeds, look no further.",Best Currrent Chia Seed Deal on Amazon.
"summarize: This is one of those situations where you really need to look at what you're ordering. I was expecting a large box of cookies but instead got this tiny 5 ounce box with a handful of macaroons in it.<br /><br />My fault, because it DOES say it's a 5 ounce box but it's not in the product name, features, or description, you have to scroll down to the shipping weight (5 ounces) to see that, or zoom in and read the box.<br /><br />The price is way too high for the amount of macaroons you actually get so be warned that unless you only plan on eating one macaroon at a time you're pretty much buying this for a one-time snack (maybe there's 10 macaroons in the box) and for the price? It's not worth it in my opinion and especially not with the shipping cost.<br /><br />On the taste side the macaroons are good (if you like macaroons but if you don't you shouldn't be buying this anway) but be warned that they are sweetened with maltitol which can have a laxative effect if you eat too many but in my opinion and experience there's not really enough in one box to cause that problem.<br /><br />I give 3 stars because technically if you read what you're buying there should be no surprises and the macaroons DO taste like macaroons even with the zero carb aspect so I can't complain too much because had I read the page thoroughly I would have known what I was getting myself into. But I also would not have purchased the product.<br /><br />There are better low carb snack products out there so unless you REALLY like macaroons and feel like spendg 75 cents for each one (which is roughly the size of an average strawberry) it's probably not worth it.","Small box, too expensive for what you actually get."
"summarize: Tastes good, smooth...I thought (husband thought it tasted salty and chalky compared with our reverse osmosis system).  I like the idea of the alkalinized pH and electrolytes...but I'm not willing to spend the amount asked for this product.  For pennies on the dollar I can mix an electrolyte formula at home, add some gatorade powder, or eat a salted banana or some prunes to restore electrolytes.  I also am certain that the pH will make no difference long term if one's diet is not also addressed (in which case this water is no longer needed).  There is a lot of information available online about the acidity of foods and the types of symptoms one can expect if they have trouble with pH...and what to do about it.  I'd rather spend my money on the right food than on expensive bottled water that is likely no better than what I already have under my kitchen sink.  I did like the 1.5L bottle, I liked the water...I just am not convinced it is worth the price or the convenience.",Like the Idea...Not Sold on the Product
"summarize: My 18 yr old cat (Mr.Kit T) was diagnosed with CRF and heart problems nearly 5 months ago and was near death.<br /><br />The advise of 3 vets was to put him down.  Vet#4 prescribed antibiotics, Prednisone,and Enapril. The only food advise was have T eat whatever he would eat the most of. He had dropped to under 5 lbs from his usual 9.  For 2+ months human baby food, home made chicken broth, water and Pediasure were all he'd take. T was only eating the baby food if it was hand fed to him, licking one little dab at a time off the tip of my finger.  He refused most other foods after a taste test including the expensive prescription brands.<br /><br />Despite mixed reviews of the Neo diet I decided to try it.<br />T ate 1/3 of the first can all by himself with no prompting. In the past 2 1/2 months he will consistently eat this stuff and has gained a couple pounds. He likes it better when the can is freshly opened. If it has been refrigerated, bringing it up to room temp. & sprinkling 1/2 a crushed PetAg Taurine tablet and 1 Vetri-science Renal Essential tablet on top will get him going. (Note he will not touch it if it has been microwaved even for a second!).  On a good day he can finish 1 1/2 cans but mostly it's 1 can/day.  He now is back to batting paper balls around and the occasional catch-me-if-you-can chase around the house. He still has some problems with hard stools so I also add ~1 1/2 Tbsp cooked oatmeal, 2-3 Tbsp cooked, mashed sweet potato per Week and 1/4 tsp. Kefir live cheese/yogurt ~ every other day.<br /><br />Can't say for sure how much of the change is due to the Neo, drugs or other supplements but since Neo is 95% of his diet, I have to believe it is a major factor.  May not be the same for all cats but it has saved me a lot of time and expense in comparison to the first couple months of this final journey.",Hi-Thor Neo diet for senior CRF cat
"summarize: I purchased this item after moving to a more vegan based diet.  I say vegan based because I am not strict, but try to significantly limit dairy and meat.  I work out daily and have been looking for ways to get more protein into my diet.  I have liked the Nutiva Hemp a lot.  I mix it into a blended smoothie once or twice per day.  Plain non-sweatened soy milk, banana, frozen strawberries, frozen peaches, frozen blueberries, and 3 tablespoons of the Nutiva.  The smoothie tastes great and goes down very easily.  Nutiva Hemp gives the smoothie a nuttier taste than it would have otherwise but fairly complimentary to the smoothie.  I have tried only once mixing the protein powder into a glass of water and drinking directly... let's just say I recommend sticking to mixing into smoothies.",Great Taste - Easy to Mix
"summarize: I have always fed my dogs Science Diet and they seemed to do ok, but now with all the buzz about dog diets, I wanted mine to  have the best so I switched to Blue Buffalo. It was very expensive and I have 4 dogs, so I had to keep trying to find it on sale.(a losing battle) One day I tried another brand and my dogs liked it but it was recalled, so I knew I had to find a reliable brand and stick to it. I returned to Blue Buffalo. They seemed to really like it so I decided to stay with it. Then one day on Amazon, I noticed Natural Balance Ultra Premium for small breeds. The price was great, the ingredients were great, so I ordered it. I still had some Blue Buffalo left so I kept it in one bowl and put Natural Balance in another bowl. I figured I'd let the dogs choose. They ate all of the Natural balance and just ignored the other. I filled the bowl again and again they ate all of the Natural Balance and ignored Blue. My dogs made their choice and I'm sticking with it.",Dogs like it better than Blue Buffalo
"summarize: Altho this is a good pho base to make at home, however, the expiration is not visibly outside on the box but on the bottom of the jar inside the box.  I bought a couple of these from a local store and have been using them last week.  Just now I notice that they have expired three months ago.  I checked the box and see no dates so I made a call to VV Foods asking why expiration is not outside on the box instead.  The lady told me that the FDA's law that they have to have an expiration date stamped on the bottom or on the lid of the jar and not the outside packaging.  Also,  it's the store's responsibility to check and rotate the products.  She then educate me that consumers have the right to open the boxes to check on expiration dates and take back to store for refund if products expired.  Uh, each box contains 2 spice packages inside and for a customer to open the boxes up just to get a non-expired product would look very weird and even a waste of time.  And really made no sense at all.<br /><br />What if you buy from online because they're not available at local stores?  I don't think it would be a problem with Amazon to refund and/or resend but if it is Amazon's responsibility to open up the packaging to check for expiration dates before sending them to their customers would cause a problem in their shipping lines.",Check the expiration date on bottom of jar.
"summarize: Cats do occasionally need a little green in their diet.  Not a whole lot, but their typical ""prey"" in the wile would probably have vegetation in their stomachs when killed and eaten.  That being said, my kitties are weird and love to eat vegetables.  I have a toddler that likes to throw his food around so inevitably some ends up on the floor, and they are there to pounce when it falls!  The ingredients in this food are wholesome, my kitties eat this food whole peas and all, and it makes their coats wonderfully soft and silky.  This is not the only wet food I feed them, but it is one I do plan on keeping in their wet food rotation.  I give it my solid recommendation.","This DOES have whole peas in it, but it is a good food."
"summarize: What a pleasant surprise Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit provided! I was a little leery, having tried a number of boxed dinner kits that were bland and disappointing. I wondered if I should spice it up a little, but decided against it because I wanted to review the product without tinkering.<br /><br />Kraft supplies everything but the chicken, and there is a spice packet, but I still wasn't convinced this was going to be much more than mac & cheese with a few pieces of broccoli and chicken. WRONG!<br /><br />On a night when dinner was left to the last minute, I prepared the Chicken & Broccoli skillet and served it with fresh picked tomatoes and basil. Not expecting much, we were amazed how good it was, certainly as good (if not better) than a meal from a family restaurant. It is superior to the frozen skillet and microwave steamer dinners we've tried (and we've tried a wide variety). As for spicing it up--that's totally unnecessary. We both thought the meal was delicious. In fact, we couldn't wait to have the leftovers (which were still good).",Amazingly Good Dinner from a Box
"summarize: My dog would consistently get itchy at various times of the year, especially in spring and fall.  We attributed her symptoms to seasonal changes in weather.  However, after I started giving her Blue Buffalo Wilderness Salmon dry dog food, her allergies basically disappeared.  This is a slightly more expensive dog food, but my dog will get this for the rest of her life.  It saved me a lot of money on vet bills and allergy prescriptions.<br />Her dry fur grew long and silky.  Her energy level increased with this food.<br />The ingredient list is impressive as well.  It has real protein.<br />My dog would ordinarily turn away from dry dog food, but this particular bag has a lot of small flavor bits in it in between larger dry chunks.  It seems like the flavor bits are very appealing to my dog.<br />Please make sure to give your dog water with this dog food.",Great food for my dog's allergies
"summarize: I use a French press exclusively. I rarely make espresso but I love espresso beans. I also grind to a fine grind rather than coarse so this being said your results may vary. This coffee is not one to make me shout wow, but it is a very good drinkable cup. As I pour the hot water into the press I can see a little bit of crema forming on the top. I give this product four stars more for the value than the flavor. The quality is good and the Java Trading Company boasts of their ""air roasting"" method. I have also tried ""Jet City"" from them which I thought was superior to Java Gold.<br />The texture in my mouth is smooth and the flavor complex with a tiny hint of sweet spicy. In my opinion a better cup of coffee than Pike's Place or Verona. For the money it is a better value than some of the lower priced LaVassa but it doesn't come close to Crema de Oro. This coffee if I had to guess is more African/Asian than South American.<br /><br />I've been drinking it daily now for about 40 days and am almost bored. It is satisfying but I will be exploring more. Looking for that cup that makes me shout wow.",Looking for that cup that makes me shout wow.
"summarize: One of the items I picked up on my latest visit to my local Costco Warehouse store was a huge 2.5 pound can of Kirkland Signature Super Extra-Large Virginia Peanuts. I've never seen such a large can. These ought to last a while! Plus the can has a replaceable top to help preserve freshness.<br /><br />The peanuts are lightly roasted and lightly salted. They are completely devoid of their skins. Good crunchyness. Good flavor, if slightly somewhat bland. It's a good buy for me in that I've cut down on meats and other animal products as a matter of health and peanuts have no animal fats nor cholesterol, yet offer a good protein component to the diet.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",These Ought to Last a While!
"summarize: I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my family.  It's exactly as described, a 10 lb box (bag inside) of Organic Soba.<br /><br />If you enjoy eating soba then you're probably accustomed to a certain taste.  I grew up eating soba and a variety of other noodles.  The taste is comparable to a standard soba you could buy in an Asian foods market.<br /><br />The value is good for these, it's June now and I still haven't gone through it all.  The box holds the noodles well, I haven't had an instance where the noodles don't taste as fresh as they did the day I opened them.<br /><br />I would highly recommend these for anyone looking for a bulk case of soba noodles.",Perfect for people who love Soba
"summarize: I actually bought a small box of this tea just to try it out. I used it for a few weeks and thought ""That was good, but nothing special."" But after 2 weeks of being back on my old tea, I miss it. So I'm buying some more. :) My normal US tea is Newmans Organic or Luzianne, so that's all I have to compare it to.<br /><br />Note: Each PG bag has about 2 times the weight of tea that 1 bag of a US tea bag has. Or put another way, 2 PG bags equal 1 ""family"" bag of US tea. So while it looks more expensive, in the long run it's not really. In fact, I can make a full gallon of ice tea with just 8 of these bags. So the price is about the same or better, and the tea tastes better in my opinion.",Robust tea flavor. Very happy with it.
summarize: I follow a low carb life style and so I do miss having a variety of crunchy things to eat (other than bacon :) ... so I tried this on recommendation from a friend. They are very hard to chew in my opinion and make a bit of a mess when you bite into them as you either have to chew off a hunk to eat or the whole thing crumbles into a mess.<br /><br />And that all would be okay if the flavor was quite so intense. I know Parmesan cheese is a strong cheese flavor naturally but this seems to kick it up a notch. I wanted to use these crisps as a platform for spreads and such but the flavor of the crisp overwhelms anything I would put on it.<br /><br />I won't be buying these again.,Okay but very strong flavor of Parmesan
"summarize: I have a small mixed-breed dog, about the size of a large chihuahua. She has always loved Beneful (just like my last dog who lived to a ripe old age), but she tended to only eat dry food when she became impatient for me to give her a little canned dog food. I would only give her small amounts of other food, wanting her to make her dry Beneful her main meal. I realized that the large dry food bites were probably too much work for her.<br /><br />When I found out about the IncrediBites, I couldn't wait to give them a try. I have to admit that I was disappointed to only be able to find the 15.5 lb bags at the grocery store, because I have heard that dry dog food actually contains some moisture and large bags tend to get dry and stale if it takes you too long to use them. The good news is that the bag has a zip-loc closure, so that should help retain some moisture. If you have several dogs, 15.5 lbs may be fine for you, but I plan to order some smaller bags here on Amazon.<br /><br />Anyway, my little dog now LOVES this new just-her-size kibble, and I probably fill her bowl about four times as often as I did with the larger pieces.<br /><br />I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 because I can't say for sure that this dog food is the healthiest dry dog food. My last dog was overweight, and I eventually had to switch her to the Healthy Weight flavor which she definitely did not like as well. That told me that the ""regular"" flavor has something really GOOD tasting in it. My daughter has three large dogs, and they too love Beneful. But two out of the three are overweight as well. So since I haven't done the research to determine how healthy Beneful is, I can't really make a judgment on that.<br /><br />I tried feeding my dog something ""healthy"" and expensive from the pet store, but she wouldn't touch it. I suppose it's the same principle as when I choose a juicy hamburger over a turkey burger. All I know is that she gobbles the Beneful up. So for now, I will stick with what she loves, and she loves Beneful IncrediBites.",My little dog loves these little bites...just her size.

I still couldn't tell you what the flavor was.  Some sort of ""fruit punch"".  It does do what it says it is supposed to do which is give you an energy pick up.  I have tried a bunch of different energy drinks from various companies and they are all pretty similar.  Lots of caffeine, Vit B, guarana, and similar ingredients.  There effectiveness depends on individuals' resistance to these stimulants.  I drink several cups of coffee and/or energy drinks a day so the effects are there but minimal compared to my wife who is smaller and will only have an occasional cup of tea or coffee.

"summarize: I just got this 3-jar set today and tried the salsa. I was excited because I had been reading reviews from other Amazon buyers that said the salsa was excellent! Normally, Amazon's reviewers are quite accurate in their recommendations but this time they were just flat out wrong. The salsa is very watery - right away as you tip the jar back and forth, the salsa runs around very quickly and I was suspicious that it would not have enough chunky goodness that makes a salsa tasty. I was absolutely right. The salsa has a thin watered down flavor. There is a muted spiciness that is not worth spending money for. The fire-roasted detail was worthless - it just meant that you would see black flakes from the grilled vegetables swimming around in the watered down salsa. You can get a better salsa at any supermarket - just tip the jar around to make sure that its contents move slowly and look for salsa that markets itself as having won awards at salsa fairs or by chefs.

"summarize: My g/f got me a popcorn maker for Xmas. Knowing that I really only go to the movies anymore just for the popcorn, we decided to try and replicate it on our own.  There are several ways to achieve that. Mainly the oil and salt topping, but kernels should not be over looked.  I went with this gift set because it has 6 types of kernels ranging from very light and airy(think carnival or circus popcorn) to medium grade and color(movie theaterish but better) to dark and small(cant compare to anything).  It also comes with popcorn salt and butter topping that seal the deal. The southwestern spice is delicious but I rarely use it on the fresh batches.  I prefer to save it for the tail end as it makes me sneeze.  I rate this 5 stars and would certainly recommend to a friend. Best of all you can sample about 5-8 batches of each flavor before you decide which kernel you want to buy in bulk.  They are all great, but my favorite is the Red River valley with 2 parts salt to 1 part butter topping.<br /><br />**You will want to buy some coconut oil to pop in for the true theater taste and color.",Great Popcorn kit for fans or lovers.
"summarize: After trying various wet and dry cat foods for my then 6, now 7 year old cat, I finally tried the regular version of Natural Balance Cat food. He liked it more than anything else that I tried and so I stuck with that until I noticed that he still had a bit of a gut.<br /><br />I initially bought a small bag of the reduced calorie formula because I was worried he wouldn't like it. That disappeared as soon as I gave him a bowl of the reduced calorie formula. He munched on it like it was the regular formula.<br /><br />Since then, I buy the big 15 pound bags about every three months or so. I use an automatic feeder so that he can eat whether or not I am able to get out of bed that day. Even though he has access to a month's supply via the automatic feeder, he doesn't have the gut he used to. He's still a BIG cat, but not that much overweight, which is much better for his health.",My cat loves it just as much as the non-reduced calorie version!
"summarize: The seller shipped the tree very quickly via express mail.  It was packed well to protect the tree.  The tree is smaller than I imagined from the picture.  This was somewhat silly on my part, since they said it is a bonsai, which means it should be small but look big.  The tree is about 9 inches tall and potted in a cup sized plastic pot.  I've transplanted it to a gallon sized pot, which should give it room for few years, since these trees are very slow growing.  Though small, the tree is in spectacular condition with a mass of tiny leaves.  Mine is even better looking than the one pictured.<br /><br />I plan to let the tree grow into a full sized potted tree.  I plan to keep in outside until cool weather and then bring it inside for the winter, since I live in USDA zone 7.  When it gets bigger, the tree should look similar to a potted ficus tree.  I saw a picture of a grown one bearing fruit and had to have one of my own even though it can't survive winter outside in my area.  In a few years it will bear grape-like fruits, which are attached to the trunk rather than the ends of limbs as is normal for almost all other fruit trees.",Great little tree a great price

"summarize: I was so eager to try this dressing based upon the stellar review posted though my intuition and experience have taught me that when there is only one review to be cautious. I thought the Biltmore name might add some additional assurance, so I overnighted it with my wonderful Prime membership as I had to make an enormous pasta salad for the same day I received it but thought it was going to be a safe bet. NOT SO. The flavor of this dressing was so sharp and off that it ruined the entire dish and I had to apologize to everyone as I had already committed all of my ingredients to the salad I had made and had no time or resources to make another one, which also would have been extremely expensive.<br /><br />Even the aroma when I opened the bottle (and opened a second one with the same result) was a bit skunky but I was optimistic that when combined with other ingredients it would reveal the great flavor cited by the first reviewer. I will never use or buy this dressing again. : - ( I'd give this zero stars, but that's not an option.",Would NOT recommend this to anyone!
"summarize: I knew it was a pipe dream to think this product would be 'good' pho, but as an avid pho lover, I had to try it. The verdict? It doesn't really taste like Pho, but it's pretty good WITH some work.<br /><br />Eating this stuff right out of the box is a sure letdown for any person who desires something that actually tastes like Pho. I adore two things about Annie Chun noodle bowls, and that's the dehydrated vegetables and noodles. The veges rehydrate and look/taste like somewhat fresh veges, which is a feat on its own. The noodles are thick and chewy, which I enjoy. However... they just don't belong in pho. The noodles are totally uncharacteristic of real pho, and the veges are missing some important flavors (namely cilantro). On top of all that, the sauce to make the broth really tastes nothing like pho broth. I searched and searched for that cinnamon and star anise that you generally taste in real pho, and it's just not there.<br /><br />On the plus side, it's pretty easy to soup this up (pun fully intended). To get this to taste like a halfway decent bowl of pho like I'm used to, I add a few things. First and foremost, a hefty amount of sriracha sauce (I like my pho's broth to be a rich red, very spicy, but delicious). I also take some steak and slice it very thinly, layer it on the bottom of the bowl, and pour the boiling water over it and allow it to sit for 3-4 mins to get a nice med-rare cut of meat in there. While that's sitting, I dice up a good amount of cilantro and toss that in, along with a good handful of bean sprouts. Once that's all in, I put in a pinch of sugar (the sauce has a sour aftertaste if you don't), and then I eat. Sounds like a lot of work, but it takes me about 15 minutes to make a very filling bowl of ""pho"". It still isn't quite there as the broth is missing some complex flavors, but it's actually not bad. I would give it 4-4.5 stars after said additions are done.","Hardly pho, but not bad with a lot of work"
"summarize: The turmeric arrived much faster than expected, and the quality was far superior than expected.<br /><br />I have used turmeric in my cooking for many years, both for Indian-inspired dishes and also for the coloring effects it adds to certain dishes or components of dishes.<br /><br />A few month ago, my mother got me into taking turmeric for the health benefits.  She was having extreme respiratory issues and problems with severe arthritis.  She had several traditional medical treatments and nothing seemed to be working.  After she did a bunch of research, she found a bunch of information regarding the health benefits of turmeric.  After taking turmeric twice a day for about 8 weeks, she was able to be taken off of oxygen and she no longer has problems with her arthritis.  She is no longer taking any other medications and has no further problems as long as she continues to take her turmeric every day.<br /><br />If you are planning on taking turmeric for the health benefits, I highly recommend you do some research first.  The basics are that you need to take about 1 tsp of turmeric mixed into a liquid that contains a fat (such as whole milk) along with about 1/4 tsp of ground black pepper (the black pepper helps with absorption and the nutrients in the turmeric need the fat because they are fat-soluble and not water-soluble).  Do the research before you begin and don't just take my word for it... there are a lot of very respectable medical institutions currently conducting research on turmeric for treating such things as arthritis, acne, joint pain, pain management, respiratory problems, and even cancer, so you should have no problems finding more information online.<br /><br />I usually just take powdered turmeric in a not-too-revolting mixture recipe that I got from my mother: I mix 1 1/2 tsp of powdered turmeric in a 12oz glass of V8 along with 1 tsp of olive oil, 1/4 tsp of fresh ground pepper, 1 Tbs of raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar, 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper, and 1/4 tsp of granulated garlic.  (all that's missing is the vodka)<br /><br />The bottom line is that this turmeric powder is not only great quality, but it is also very inexpensive and in a much larger volume than you might expect.  Shipping was also very fast and I will be buying from this seller again in the future.",Wonderful for both cooking and for health
"summarize: I just purchased my second jar of this organic raw honey.  I use it often as an ingredient to prepare desserts or fruit smoothies.  It's absolutely delicious!  The key to using this honey is to melt it properly before mixing in with the other ingredients.  I usually scoop out about a tablespoonful of this honey, place it in a small bowl, and microwave it for about 20-30 seconds.  Then the honey is ready to be used in my fruit smoothies (or plain greek yogurt).<br /><br />It's a great combination with sliced bananas or even drizzle a little over celery sticks.  A jar lasts about two months (I use it about 2-3 times a week).<br /><br />The packaging that the jar was wrapped in is also very good.",Great for making desserts or eating with fruit
"summarize: These have become staples in our house. I first picked up the ""Blueberry Blitz"" from our local super-market, but the only other flavors they carried were ""fruit-only"". I really liked the fact that you get at least some veggies in these (albeit a few places down on the ingredient list). So I came to Amazon and ordered ""Carroty-Chop"" and ""Beetbox Berry"". So far the kids (boys aged 4 and 6) love them. They are an easy snack to throw in the lunch box or to take on the road. I also like that they have a long shelf life and they are certified organic by the Oregon Tilth, one of the more stringent organic certification agencies.<br /><br />Here are the ingredient lists since I don't see them on Amazon:<br />Blue-Berry Blitz: organic apple puree, organic blueberry puree, organic carrot puree, organic purple carrot juice, organic lemon juice<br />Carroty Chop: organic apple puree, organic carrot puree, organic mango puree, organic orange juice, organic lemon juice<br />Beetbox Berry: organic apple puree, organic strawberry puree, organic carrot puree, organic beet juice, organic lemon juice<br /><br />They are all 60 calories and have 11 grams of sugar.<br /><br />I've also taken to buying the ""Peter Rabbit Organics"" which have more vegetables mixed in with the fruit and are a little larger. My kids prefer the Mashups, but they also like the Peter Rabbit brand, so I just have a big basket of them all mixed in and I grab what makes sense. If we've dined out and they didn't get a lot of veggies I give them a ""Peter Rabbit"" for bedtime snack. If I'm just adding a little something to their lunch box I'll throw in a Mashup. It does help keep the kids away from the junk food, particularly at snack time. A great tool in the ""trying to feed the kids healthy stuff"" arsenal.<br /><br />And to be honest I've been known to grab one when I need a quick snack. They taste pretty good, and it's better than grabbing cookies or chips.",A great healthy snack to keep around for the kids
"summarize: These little seeds are supposedly very nutritious, so eating them has a reward besides the taste or how filling they are.  They actually taste okay; not as tasty as sunflower seeds, but not bad and they are easy to add to a lot of things.  I found that I was slightly allergic to them and everytime I ate them, my sinuses would start draining like crazy and I'd begin coughing, so they aren't something I'll be continuing to eat.  But for most people, that wouldn't be a problem. You can even use them to grow sprouts if you'd prefer something more veggie-like.  Those who grow the sprouts say that they make tiny little sprouts, but good to eat.  I grew a ""chia pet"" years ago, but don't remember what the sprouts looked like.  I do remember that they sprouted easily, so that shouldn't be a problem for would-be sprout-growers.","Nothing I'd crave, but not bad"
"summarize: Well, I wish this mix was as good as reflected in the other reviews.<br />Tried the waffle recipe from the package. I guess we're not used to the ""healthy"" ingredients. Not such an appetizing taste or texture and the cooking waffles make a decidedly unpleasant smell. Funky, burned corn and whole wheat aroma? Lingered for hours.<br />In addition the waffle recipe calls for 1 cup of mix and does not make even 2 whole waffles in a standard sized maker. Not the usual waffle expansion or fluffiness but hey it's ""healthy.""<br /><br />Will need to come up with suitable additions or this stuff will go unused or well maybe the birds will get a treat.<br />Or not...",Not So Good  -Don't Scratch and Sniff-
"summarize: I might be an adult but I still love mac and cheese and the ""crazy bugs"" gimmick got me. I picked this up at Walmart for $1.25. I prepared it on the stove and I was really annoyed to find out that the cheese packet powder is WHITE, and not ORANGE like they advertise on the box. I hate when the cheese is white, it looks so unappetizing. The taste isn't horrible but it's nothing special at all. My husband tried it and refused to take more than a bite, and he'll eat anything. All these positive reviews are just buying into the Natural gimmick.",My husband wouldn't even eat it!
"summarize: While I'm not a chocoholic, what I want out of a chocolate bar is the following: It doesn't give me a migraine (I got my first migraine ever after eating a Dove Bar in the 80's, and I've eaten chocolate from chocolate bars that have been followed by migraines); it's delicious; I feel good immediately after eating it; it's priced right. With the exception of the migraines, this is all subjective, and whether or not consuming a certain food will result in someone getting a migraine is obviously unique to the individual.<br /><br />Chocolate prices have been rising lately (I'm writing this on Feb. 23, 2011), due to a 12% rise in the price of cocoa coming from the Ivory Coast, which is the largest producer of cocoa beans in the world. Other than that the chocolate for Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bars are from cocoa grown on Rainforest Alliance Certified farms, I do not know which country these farms are located in, but I imagine that the rise in the wholesale price of cocoa beans affects the entire retail market for chocolate. Non-gourmet chocolate bars are presently priced at under a dollar per ounce retail (e.g., 38 cents an ounce for one type and size Hershey's Dark Chocolate bar, 58 cents an ounce for Lindt), while one type and size of a gourmet Godiva Dark Chocolate bar sells at present for $1.58 an ounce. It looks like the Newman bars are selling for around $1.44 an ounce (I say ""looks like"" because the retail price depends on the size of each bar, how many are in a pack, etc., etc.). So for gourmet chocolate, that's an acceptable price, IMO.<br /><br />I received one 2.25 ounce bar to sample for review purposes and I found that I could only eat two of the six squares the bar is scored into at one time (and per day) before I felt sated on chocolate. Chocolate and dark chocolate in particular may or may not have some health benefits (you know the drill, what's supposed to be good for us is constantly changing), but I buy dark chocolate bars and eat them one or two squares at a time (per day) because I enjoy eating a little chocolate and in case there really are health benefits. Given my fairly modest chocolate consuming habits, I think I can afford Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bars, and so they meet all of my standards for what I want out of a chocolate bar. The taste is quite rich and that suits me fine, as it means that for me, a little bit goes a long way.",has what I want from a chocolate bar
"summarize: As someone who doesn't get nearly enough sleep, I am always looking for an effective and tasty caffeine boost. Problem is, I don't like the taste of coffee, and soda has high calories-to-caffeine ratio. Energy drinks typically have a chemical taste that doesn't sit well with me. The Zipfizz Grape Energy Drink Mix provides an excellent boost of energy, yet tastes pretty good. I get as much energy from one tube than I would from a cup of coffee or Red Bull. If you've had a five-hour energy shot you'll understand the type of boost you get from a Zipfizz. It has no calories from sugar, and is low carb, plus since you are mixing it with water you stay pretty hydrated. One caveat: do not drink one of these in the evening unless you plan on staying up really late; I drank one at about 6pm and was up past 3am. Thankfully, I didn't feel jittery or irritable, just WIDE awake. Also, other reviews have mentioned that this keeps you regular, and yes it does indeed.",Pleasant tasting with a nice energy buzz.
"summarize: Have no clue how old that bar of chocolate was the person who gave this bar 1 star got or what kind of radical temperature changes it went through to make it grainy because Green and Black's milk chocolate bar with almonds is one the best, creamiest, smoothest, richest chocolate bars I have ever eaten.  Not only is the flavor and texture of the bar outstanding but the amount of whole roasted almonds they pack into this bar make it a cut above the rest. It is a perfect balance of milk chocolate and nuts. I have in fact brought my mother over to the dark side.  She would normally prefer popcorn or an apple over a candy bar until she tried this. Pricey but in this instance  you get what you pay for and if you eat it slowly you will enjoy every bite.",One of the Best milk chocolate bars with almonds....
"summarize: I was introduced to truffle oil on a trip to Italy about 10 years ago.  Since then I have been looking for an online source from which I could easily replenish my supply.  I use it dabbled on top of pizza, in pasta sauces, in risotto and other dishes.  This oil is made by infusing extra virgin olive oil with white truffles, then filtered.  The ingredients on the label are listed as:<br /><br />Extra virgin olive oil, olive oil, white truffles (0.2%), white truffle flavour<br /><br />This bottle also has a ""best before:"" date stamp on it.  I ordered mine in Aug 2012.  The date stamp said best by December 2013.",Fantastic Truffle Oil condiment to have in your pantry
"summarize: All in all, a pretty tasty dish. The biscuits come out and golden brown and the filling part has a nice chicken pot pie consistency. You can put in your own favorite add-ins, I personally add mushrooms and about 5 oz of canned chicken breast (I like it extra chickeny).  It feeds two adults and two small kids if you have sides.  You only have to get the baking dish and one mixing bowl dirty.  Best thing is that you can always have it in your pantry, ready to go if you need it.  Also, don't worry if when you put in the biscuit mixture and it sinks to the bottom out of sight through the thin soup mixture, the soup eventually thickens and the biscuits float to the top and bake up real nice.",Good shelf stable product to have on hand
"summarize: Just back from a trip to Japan, hungry for some good nabeyaki udon, I ordered this stock. There's got to be something better on the market. I love salt, and dashi should be salty, but not overwhelmingly so. And why sugar, let alone two or three types of sugar? While I don't have a problem with MSG myself, I do try to avoid it. Probably my own fault; I should have specified ""No MSG"", except it never occurred to me that a package with this many bad chemicals wouldn't be labelled somewhere!<br />Outside of any of this, the dashi has none of the complexity or subtlety you hope for in a dashi base. I know if I want all of that, I need to make it from scratch, but since purchasing this I've tried several non-MSG brands and all of them are better. Sad to say, because Ajinomoto is a venerable company, but stick with Maruhachi or one of the other, healthier brands!",Should have read the bad review first.
summarize: I really love my Keurig brewer but after my third purchase of highly priced tea and coffee K-cups I knew I needed a more cost efficient solution. I purchased a My K-cup for the unit which allowed me to use regular canned coffee but what was I going to do about the tea? I tried opening tea bags and using that tea but it was weak and flat. Next I tried using this tea and it worked perfect (but a word of caution...remove the tea leaves from the filter while moist to make removal easier). No more brewing an entire teapot for just a quick morning cup and no waiting for tea bags to brew and it tastes great!!! Not weak and off taste but perfect. My tea consumption has increased to the point that I now use the Amazon auto ship to receive 6 boxes at a time so that I never run out. If you have a Keurig and love tea this product is the perfect solution...you won't be disappointed.,Works great with a Keurig Brewer !!!
"summarize: Senseo is my favorite coffee maker.  Of all the coffee pods I've tried from Senseo and other brands, I keep coming back to Paris.  It is consistently a delight.  I've had trouble finding it in the market because of popularity and now, flavored pods are becoming scarce.  No problem.  I have my subscription to back me up and make it easy.<br /><br />I love coffee, and I do not drink a lot of it.  So I want something that is a delight, and I want to be able to have a supply available so when I run out, I don't have to go on a hunting expedition to get it.  This plan is perfect for that need.  You can skip a shipment if need be, or increase your order.  It is flexible, more cost effect than the stores, and reliable in availability.<br /><br />What more could you want?",Simply the Best -- I order consistently & this subscription makes it easy!
"summarize: I am always on the look out for soy free food and when I found this at my grocery store I literally screamed with excitement.  Truthfully these aren't as good as saltine crackers, but hey, they're made with better ingredients and soy free.  I ordered these from amazon and I'm very disappointed with how they held up in shipping.  I generally end up with about 15 whole crackers and the rest ranges from 3/4 of the cracker to a crumb per box.  I can't recommend getting these delivered to your door unless your area doesn't have them stocked at the grocery store.",Soy free crackers that hate being shipped
"summarize: It was a bit of a surprise to see how poor the reviews of this soup are. In terms of taste and texture, this chicken noodle soup is very close to the 18-ounce Healthy Choice Chunky chicken soup that Amazon also sells. And that gets five-star ratings from reviewers.<br /><br />This soup has a fairly rich and tangy chicken broth. The noodles are substantial and just about as good as canned noodles can possibly be. There are chunks of white chicken meat in the soup. There is also a hint of other vegetables (carrots, I think) in the broth. The Healthy Choice version of this soup is actually a bit more bland than this soup because the use of salt is minimized. The 10-ounce size of the can makes this an ideal choice for a quick snack, whereas the 18-ounce Chunky soups are a bit too large as a snack for one person.<br /><br />So what's not to like? The negative reviews seem to focus on three things: the soup is watery, the cans are too small, and the price is too high. Let me take these in turn:<br /><br />1. The Chunky soup line is not condensed soup. I know from other reviews that some people think it is, add water, and then complain that the soup tastes watery. This soup actually has an appropriate amount of broth as it is. That broth is fragrant and has a distinctive chicken-y taste. If you add water, though, it will taste watery.<br /><br />2. The cans are exactly as big as Amazon claims. I know some people buy this expecting the big Chunky soup cans sold in supermarkets, and these people understandably feel disappointed. I had to learn myself to be careful and check the quantity or volume with any online grocery purchases.  But as I said above, the 20-ounce cans are ideal for quick snacks. I knew I was buying something in smaller cans, and I personally found this size preferable.<br /><br />3. The soup right now is in fact overpriced at $22. The Healthy Choice 12-pack of 18-ounce chicken noodle soup costs less, around the $18-19 range. That's a much better deal. When I got this particular item from Amazon, I paid about $13. The soup is a good deal at that price. Any higher, and it's a poor deal.<br /><br />By the way, I add Parmesan cheese and baco-bits to this soup. It makes for a more entertaining treat. I hope some of this proves helpful.",An excellent soup with a bad rep
"summarize: A few months ago I discovered Mentos gum, and loved the way the gum had a very long lasting chewability.  The first flavors I tried were Watermelon and Red Fruit.  After some online searching I found that there were a number of different flavors, so I ordered some of each flavor so I could have my own little taste test.  After all of the sampling, Sweet Mint emerged as my absolute favorite.  It has just a little bit of a mint bite, and proved to be very enjoyable.  A lot of the mint gums just completely overpower you when you start chewing on them.  I now order the Sweet Mint flavor by the box, so I can always have a good supply on hand.  Watermelon anod Red Fruit are still on hand, too - just not in the quantity!",This is my new favorite gum!!
"summarize: This product allows people to make their own salad dressing without the hassle of mixing herbs together themselves.<br /><br />I dislike buying salad dressing in pre-made jars because manufacturers tend to add too many preservatives and use low quality oil.  This product allows me to select my own olive oil and red wine vinegar.  Then, I can add as much or as little seasoning as I desire.  In the past, I typically just mixed olive oil and vinegar together to use as a salad dressing.  This product allows me to add seasoning similar to the seasoning in pre-made salad dressings.<br /><br />This product is also nice because everyone at the table can mix his/her own dressing.  Not everyone enjoys the same mixture of ingredients and this item allows everyone to create an individual dressing for his/her salad.<br /><br />Finally, my best estimate is that this jar should be good for about 50 average size salads.",Create your own herb salad dressing
"summarize: This tea is very good, but the packaging is quite deceptive. To begin with, it is not powdered matcha tea, but a leaf tea that is a blend (you can see that it is a blend if you look at the smaller print on the can, but it is a bit misleading). In addition, the tea only fills about a third and maybe even as little as a fourth of the container once you remove it from the bag inside the can. I would buy it again because it is very good tea, but don't buy it if you are looking for matcha and be aware that you're getting less than it might seem.",Good tea but really deceptive packaging
"summarize: We usually buy the Earth's Best brand, but thought we'd give these a shot. My 15 month old not only doesn't like the taste of these, which is mainly applesauce, but they are also extremely messy. It's almost like the pouches are overfull; barely holding them causes the puree to spew everywhere. I wouldn't recommend this product.<br /><br />Update - We tried this product again when my daughter was 20 months and had no problems with it. She loves them and doesn't make a mess with them anymore.  I still think that there are other similar products out there with better ingredients, but these aren't bad.",Make sure your child is old enough to work the packaging.

"summarize: Ordered this after reading a review on the AV Club.<br /><br />Right off the bat, it doesn't taste like spreadable bacon mixed with mayonnaise.  It reminds one of bacon, and goes great with items that you'd pair bacon with, such as burgers, eggs, etc.  However, the flavor is much better described as smokey seasoned mayonnaise. It's a little on the salty side, but that didn't bother me or most of my friends.<br /><br />This is to say that it's delicious, and again works well on just about everything you put it on. It's also vegetarian, and fun at a party or office pot luck.

"summarize: Of all the 'heat & eat' products I've tried, this is easily my favorite (though it makes too large a meal to be really practical as a one-dish microwave lunch at work, which is usually what I look for in a heat & eat product).  It makes a delicious meal for nights when actual cooking is just too much to face, but you still want to eat well (though the portions in one box are a bit skimpy for two persons, unless you add extra veggies to the Mutter Paneer sauce).<br /><br />The Basmati Pilau Rice packet cooks beautifully in the microwave, as does the Mutter Paneer (either at the same time, or -- when I want to add some fresh vegetables to take advantage of all that sauce -- poured over vegetables in a dish before 'nuking').  I've also tried sauteing extra vegetables on the stovetop and then pouring the sauce packet over them to heat up at the last, which offers more control over the doneness of all ingredients.  I favor the frying pan method, except for when washing the pan afterwards still seems like too much work.<br /><br />Strict vegetarians might want to take care, though:  there's no meat listed in the ingredients, but it always seems to me that there are a few shreds of chicken meat (or something very like it) in the Pilau.",Eating well when you don't have time to cook
"summarize: I've been purchasing this product for several years after my mom discovered them at a local nutrition store. I am allergic to soy and wheat, so my choices in protein bars are very limited. I also prefer raw and organic foods to processed.<br /><br />These bars are a good source of protein without soy, wheat, or gluten which I am deeply grateful for. As far as protein bars go, they are healthier than most I've found with many organic ingredients.<br /><br />I've given Dr. Smoothie 4 out of 5 stars because in my humble opinion, the sugar content is a bit excessive - 9gms for a 2 oz bar. It also includes maltodextrin which is a highly processed food additive derived from corn.

summarize: I was skeptical at first when Starbucks started calling Gold Coast morning joe (lower case on purpose) but after drinking a couple pounds now I am completely convinced it is the same and just as great as the old Gold Coast.  I'm been drinking Gold Coast for several years now and it is the only ground coffee I stock at home.  Up to now I've always purchased it at the store but am switching to Amazon since it is about 30% less expensive and I just signed up for Amazon Prime.

"summarize: The qualities and benefits of Gatorade are well established. For the past almost two years, it has been my choice of electrolyte/carb post-workout drink.

Also, it is easier to clean up the Camelback without the sugars in the fluids.

It's a great product, very concentrated and it has a nice scent like the oil, but it will last longer. This product is for dry hair, truly dry hair, the kind that one applies some of this balm on tonight and the next morning, the hair had absorbed it. I have such hair, my hair is also curly, and long. So this balm helps me to stylish it, and keeping it shining too.<br /><br />With this product less is more, one only needs to rub a little amount of the balm between one's palms before applying it all over the hair and scalp. It keeps the hair in place if stylished in a braid or a chignon.<br /><br />Its main purpose is to seal the hair from humidity, and this is easily accomplished. The best way to do this is to use the same method I described above,  applying a smaller amount of the balm to the hair right after it has been styled with the hair dryer. It will seal the hair, preventing it from becoming frizzy. This is something I learned years ago from my hairdresser, who uses a very similar, but more expensive  product to accomplish this. I definitely recommend this one to anyone with dry, frizzy hair.",Great stylish balm for dry hair
"summarize: I first tried this at a small tea house in the suburbs of Chicago at my friend's bridal shower..I could not get it out ofmy head a few days later, that's how good it is...I just had to find out the brand. I looked on the tea house's site and found it!! It's about twice the price of what I (being a cheapo) would pay for tea but it's so worth it! But if you think about it...for 50 teabags...It's about 20 cents a serving so it's actually pretty cheap. the flavor is so rich, and the tea is a bit strong tasting so only get it if you don't mind strong tea. The bergamont is not overpowering which almost always is the problem with earl grey....It's so good, really helps a person unwind and relax...Even in today's 88 degree weather I drank it and enjoyed it! It even tastes amazing after it has cooled down...best tea I've ever had in my life.",best tea ever...if you like a strong tea!
"summarize: When I was told by my nutritionist that eating a handful of whole, natural almonds a day would help me to lose weight and get the right kind of fats and proteins implemented into my diet, I was a bit skeptical.  I was not a huge almond fan to begin with.  I don't particularly enjoy salted or roasted almonds.  Usually only the kind that come surrounded with coconut and chocolate or the kind that you get out of the nut bowl to shell around the holidays.  The Whole Natural almonds by Blue Diamond taste like they came right out of the shell and boy are they yummy.<br /><br />I like that they are a satisfying snack and I like the taste of them.  These are the ones I buy ... no added salt or anything.  Nice and fresh right out of the shell.<br /><br />5 stars.",Tasty and Healthy - Good for Dieting
"summarize: I have used several brands of beans roasted specifically for espresso, but this is the one I have really enjoyed.  The flavor is rich and full.  It produces a nice crema when the grind is right as well as using the right pressure when compressing in the porta-filter.  I am using a Rocket Espresso Cellini now which seems to be doing a nice job with this bean. I did try Velton's coffee beans as sold by Seattle Coffee Gear.  They were very good as well but seemed a little too light for my taste. I prefer the Lavazza for the rich flavor pleasing as espresso or in a latte.",Lavazza - great expresso bean - robust flavor
"summarize: After a couple of days to try out these 2 Peanut butter substitutes (the regular and chocolate versions) I can say I'm a convert. I LOVE peanut butter, for me it's a trigger food. If I eat it, I tend to want to eat half the jar at once and it can lead to wanting to eat other things I know I shouldn't. I've worked damn hard to shed 170lb this past year and half and indulging in PB is something I very rarely do anymore. I'd all but given it up. So actually finding something like this, which will allow me to enjoy the occasional PB&J sandwich without the feelings of guilt and remorse is a godsend!<br />The reg. version of PB2 does have a roasted peanut taste to it, so it's not quite like regular PB, you don't get the salty sweeter taste of Jiff or Skippy. JUST the roasted peanut taste. But it's quickly adapted to. And the Chocolate version (which I was more skeptical of) was even better! You can eat either one right after you mix them with water, but I think they're best when added to something else.<br />First of all I like to mix a base of reg PB2 with the chocolate version since I prefer a bit more of the nutty flavor to the chocolate. When just eating the chocolate my first thought was this would be great on whole wheat with a smear of marshmallow creme. And I don't even like marshmallow creme. But I will probably try it out one day to see if I'm right.<br />Either spread works great on fruit. I've tried apples and bananas so far. I also tried a PB&J with reduced calorie jelly and it worked very well. Good enough to replace the high calorie reg. PB&J sandwiches.<br /><br />It might sound strange but one combo I REALLY like is to scoop a bit of the powdered PB onto a fat free potato chip (I use Pringles fat free sour cream) and no there wasn't a taste clash or anything. I'm sure you could use the reg Pringles fat free, I just happen to think the sour cream ones taste better. Anyway turn the chip upside down and scoop a bit of powder into the ""bowl"" of the underside and eat. The salt of the chip is the first thing that hits your tongue and then the PB powered crumbs. And the combo is just....yumm!!!! Like that, it really does taste like any PB you could buy. I tried it with the chocolate version too, and there it's really like eating a peanut butter cup. And surprisingly the salty chip and powered PB isn't dry in the mouth. Quite the opposite actually. Now on the other hand, I tried adding the powdered PB2 as a topping to my skinny cow ice cream as I do on occasion like some melted PB on my ice cream, but there it DID dry out my mouth completely. Very strange. So I decided to try and mix the PB2 with water then heat it up in the microwave to see if it would melt like reg PB. It didn't. It got hot, but ended up dry like the cookie dough for peanut butter cookies where you can basically ball it up in your hands. I guess without all the fat the PB2 can't melt like standard peanut butter. So as for ice cream topping, at least so far, it hasn't worked.<br />I am looking forward to seeing what else these 2 powdered products would work with and am already planning on ordering the larger sizes as I'd like to try some baking with them too.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend them!<br /><br />Edit; Okay so it DOES work as a melted peanut butter substitute on ice cream. The key is to start with a base of water and gradually add powder to it until you get a very creamy consistency that will run off a spoon, just like melted pb *then* heat it up in the microwave. My first attempt with this method I used far too much water so be careful there. I kept adding bits of powder including the chocolate version for fear I'd use all my pb2 up. But it was so much water I couldn't thicken it up enough and decided to start over. However, rather than just throw it all out, I decided to try it out as a drink. And you know, heated up, it was like a super rich cup of cocoa....delish! Even with no added sweetener it was sweet enough. And as a plus, since it's just water you can save those calories there. Not to mention, if you're lactose intolerant like me, regular hot chocolate is out anyway.<br /><br />Now even though this stuff is 85% less than regular peanut butter it does have some calories and fat, so I wouldn't over do it. But as an occasional indulgence, I'm so happy I found this!<br /><br />PS: I just want to add since purchasing PB2 from Amazon I've found a site called ""netrition.com"" and I highly recommend buying food stuffs from them. Amazon is great for pretty much everything else, but they are way over priced on their food.<br />I bought the large 16oz pack of PB2 from netrition for only 7.99 per bag. the same price Amazon charges for the small 6.5oz size! They don't have free shipping like Amazon, but they only charge $4.95 flat shipping fee no matter how much you buy. So it's not bad. Maybe because I bought so much, or it was my first time ordering but they also sent me a free low cal. quick cook cake mix. They were also way WAY cheaper on PB2 peanut butter crackers and everything else I ordered from them.<br /><br />So like I said, Amazon is great for most things, but when it comes to food. Netrition is a whole lot better!",So Good why isn't it Bad???
"summarize: This is my favorite soup from Thai Kitchens, with Roasted Garlic being a close second and the Mushroom one being a close third.  They are easy to make, the bowl is included so you just add the seasoning, add the water, and wait a few minutes.  While I am waiting, I usually microwave some left-over meat and, if I'm up for it, some vegetables.  Then I get a larger bowl and pour everything into it, add some hot sauce, and sit down for a filling and delicious lunch.<br /><br />Plus the bowls are useful too, I keep some in the art corner for various projects & water while the kids paint, and I keep some in the kitchen to use for short-term storage while cooking or to store small amounts of food overnight in the fridge.<br /><br />While Ramen has a soft spot in my heart for getting me through college, Thai Kitchen noodles are my favorite.",Fine just the way it is but excellent with some additions...
"summarize: The first 10 ingredients list:  #4 pork by-products, #6 chicken by-products, #8 gelatin by-product, #9 wheat flour, #10 wheat gluten.

There are many grain-free brands out there that cost about the same with NO by-products like Royal Canin, Science Diet or Purina.

Get your cat started out right.<br />I have a bengal who had terrible runny poo for the first 4 months I had her, even with adding Fortiflora to Royal Canin.

"summarize: Exported from Japan, this is a very good ""fake"" wasabi powder (nearly all tubed and powdered wasabi is actually horseradish). 25g of powder is a lot, so this can will last you a long long time, making this a very economical choice for sushi lovers. I bought a tin of it 2 years ago and have still not gone through it all. To prepare, just mix with a bit of cold water and wait several minutes for the flavor to develop, then enjoy with sushi or sashimi. My directions are vague as to how much to use and how long to wait because the can's directions are not specific. Reconstituted, it's every bit as good as tubed wasabi. I find that a teaspoon of powder is more than sufficient for one person.<br /><br />Make only as much as you need and right before you are about to use it. The chemicals that give horseradish (and real wasabi) its pungency are very volatile and will dissipate quickly when exposed to air (15-30 mins). Don't think you'll save time by making a big batch of it and refrigerating it until next time. All you'll taste is a coarse paste of green goop.<br /><br />Be aware that the product description is **WRONG**. This is not an all natural product. Ingredients listed on the label: horseradish, mustard, Vitamin C, ascorbic acid, and artificial colors (Blue #1, Yellow #4). Blue #1 (Brilliant Blue FCF) is a commonly-used synthetic dye derived from petroleum. You can see it on the right side of the label in the photo if you read Japanese: chakushoku-ryou, coloring agent.<br /><br />Another excellent brand is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CNU1X"">Hime Powdered Wasabi (Japanese Horseradish)</a>, or if you prefer it in a ready-to-use tube, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YGSAU"">S&B - Wasabi in Plastic Tube (Family Size) 3.17 Oz.</a>, a very popular brand.",Very economical ounce for ounce compared to tubed wasabi
"summarize: The difference between high fructose corn syrup and suger is that sugar tastes natural and your body knows its limits. With high fructose corn syrup the opposite is true, it taste synthetic and the after taste is designed to leave you wanting more and it actually causes some issues for people, now the reason I started my review with a comparison of HFCS vs sugar is because no where is it more evident than regular dr peper vs dublin dr pepper. Many of the reviewers have said that this is heaven and while I won't go that far I can tell you with a 4 person taste test this stuff destroys the regular formula out on the market. To tell you how I know its simple, the 4 person taste test team took a regular super market can of dr. pepper(they don't make it in glass anymore) each poured out a small sampling 2 fl ounces, and tasted, each of us had the same prognosis, its way to carbonated and the flavor bites at the tongue, its almost like the tongue and the soda is having a fight and the soda is winning, to continue the test we washed out our mouths with water and did the same with the cups, then after 5 minutes we did the same with the dublin dr pepper, never in my life have I tried this stuff and I can tell you that even though its an expensive habit the soda is satisfying, not only is it smooth its not overly sweet and it does not assault the tongue instead it tastes like how dr pepper should taste and I am converted... I probably should have also mentioned that until I tried ddp I hated the taste of dr pepper they converted me the only complaint is the company that sold it to me ""thebargainbox"" needs to take some lessons in packaging their shipments one of the bottles had broken during shipment and soaked the box in ddp, and it picked up the smells of the warehouse not pleasant. Continuing on everyone in the 4 person group fell in love with this soda and now are planning on picking it up sometime in the future. Instead of suing them snapple should be selling dublin dr. pepper in every freaking store this this stuff would put everyone else out of business.<br /><br />Now its time for the imnportant information, because I know as someone who is trying to watch his weight a little bit I pay attention to this stuff here are the details on the back of the bottle, serving size is 1 8oz bottle.<br />Calorie count: 100<br />Calories from fat: 0<br />Sodium count: 35mg<br />total carbs: 27g<br />Sugars: 27g<br />protein: 0<br /> ingredients: water,imperial pure cane sugar, caramel color, phosphoric acid, natural and artificial flavoring, sodium benozate(preservative), caffeine<br /><br />To be more specific this stuff is almost the same calorie count as the 7.5 ounce 90 calorie cans you can buy in any local food store with a much, much, much, much better taste.<br /><br />If you can force yourself to like regular dr pepper in the store then you absolutely must try dublin dr pepper its better for you and tastes incredible.",hands down better than the mass produced stuff.....
"summarize: I bought this at home depot as part of a 3 pack that included a fogger and personal spray. I have fountains, a pool, large pond, grass, and an orange tree so insects love my place. I have two large windows and a sliding glass door that are COVERED in insects all day during the heat. I used this spray 8 hours ago and there's not 1 bug on the screens.

"summarize: This cereal makes getting your fiber easier, but it does not taste as good as the other products in the same line. I was expecting ""Caramel Delight"" to have a powerful caramel flavor, but found it lacking. It's not that the cereal is inedible - it tastes fine, but the flavor gets a little lost once you add milk. It's like you're eating ""healthy"" cereal - the ""clusters"" options make it much easier to feel like you're indulging and taste much better. Just be warned - don't eat too much.

The product seemed old and not freshly packed as I have noticed the fair trade packets to be in for example the local Starbucks locations. The product is not returnable hence a total waste of the $30, since our aim was to have received a fresh tasting and looking batch of sugar in packets to serve to our clients.

"summarize: I bought this recently. When I received it, I was surprised at how much you get...there is a decent amount of tea in each cute green cardboard box. (No, they didn't just toss it in a box, there is a silver bag inside the box for keeping it fresh.)<br />I like to drink chilled green tea, so I bought some Lipton green tea iced tea mix. I was sipping it (it tastes great) and thought, this stuff doesn't have enough actual green tea in it, so I did some looking around and found the powdered Macha.

(Martha Stewart's website has a recipe for green tea ice cream and green tea shortbread leaves (cookies) you could make with this powder. I look forward to trying to make ice cream with it, seems unusual.<br />The one caveat I offer for this tea is this: do NOT drink beverages made with this tea *on an empty stomach* or you will rue the day.

"summarize: Like every other Tazo iced tea lover, I was heartbroken when I read they changed the blend of their iced black tea. I had 6 of the old bags left and rationed them as long as I could. I broke down and bought a 3-pack of the new blend. The first batch was disappointing--it was a weak pitcher of iced tea that lacked color and taste. I didn't think I'd be able to drink another pitcher, let alone 3 full boxes of tea. But then I started adding 3 Irish Breakfast tea bags to the water, and I let the pitcher sit in the fridge overnight before drinking. Finally I've made a decent pitcher of tea with this new blend. It's dark and full-bodied and not half bad. I've got one bag of their old blend left and am going to try to concoct my own blend to match.<br /><br />If you like sweet tea, try taking 1/4 C brown sugar, 1/4 white sugar, mix with enough water to cover the sugar, then microwave for a minute to dissolve the sugar. Pour into the pitcher and stir, then let sit overnight. It's a delicious guilty pleasure.","Not as good as their old blend, but it's still decent"
"summarize: ....these are too chocolatey.  How could such a thing be?  I really have no idea.  I can't even figure out exactly what it is about these that I dislike for that reason.  First, I will say that they are very definitely chocolatey so you aren't going to get short-changed there.  I guess my issue is that, with this type of cookie, part of the concept is having a contrast between the outer cookie and the inner filling.  There is some difference here still, but overall it's just a major hit of chocolate.  These remind me of a chocolate truffle with cookie bits in it, only inside-out.  And as much as I love chocolate, I've never much cared for truffles for the same reason - just too much of a bomb all at once.  I dislike dark chocolate and prefer milk chocolate, so maybe that's my problem.<br /><br />So anyway - this commentary possibly having really sold you on these, I will affirm that they are a fine product  - always fresh, crispy, etc.  Just be warned!","I can't believe I'm about to write this, but...."

Unlike other dogs Boing did not experience the change of formula & so has not had the unfortunate stomach upsets. Another real plus was getting free shipping which helped with the overall cost.

"summarize: Well it was time once again to visit the grocery store and the prime item to pick up was at more cat food. Boy, the stuff really goes fast! I have two cats and both are neutered males. One (Boo) is about five years old and the other (The Fuzz) is about six. Both will gobble up any kind of cat food and eat as much of it as they can get. They're not fussy eaters at all. However, there's one problem. Boo has a condition that requires an expensive prescription food (Hills Prescription Diet C/D Multicare) or he develops little crystals in his urinary tract and that requires the expensive services of a vet. The Fuzz, on the other hand, will gobble down any kind of cat food you give him and beg for more.  However, I question giving him the same thing over and over, or even the same brand. As such, I switch around through about a half-dozen kinds my nearby store has to offer. This time I picked up a 3.15 pound bag of Friskies Seafood Sensations containing four seafood flavors plus a bit of seaweed. I gave it a first try with The Fuzz this evening. As predicted, it was gobbled right down, just like any other cat food I feed him. Evidently, the people at pet food manufacturing companies have it down as to exactly what like to eat. I might be concerned about their long-term health. However, The Fuzz has been 100% healthy on his dry catfood diet so. He loves the new Friskies Seafood Sensations, I should add. Please note that the product offered here is in a bag that is twice the size of that which I had purchased.

"summarize: These truffles are the best I've ever had before. I bought some other chocolate cocoa dusted powder truffles this year too, for some other people and I went with a different brand then this. Don't get me wrong, they were also really good, but nothing compares to me. I paid significantly more for these then I did the other ones I tried, and although they looked the same, they definitely did not taste the same. The other ones were rich and tasted good and would satisfy your sweet tooth, but if you want to taste one of the best tasting truffles ever, these are the ones to get. I thought I wasted my money at first since I paid more then the others for these, but after tasting the difference I know I got my moneys worth.<br /><br />The only problem is that these truffles were melted together when I received them. So you literally have to break them apart and they have lost some of their shape, and you can no longer see the powered cocoa on the outside because they got hot and melted. Now I saw someone else complain about this too and figured I was safe ordering them because its the coldest time of the winter so I figured theres no way they can melt now, but they were melted anyways. All I can figure is they've been sitting around somewhere for awhile, but they taste very fresh so I'm not sure what happened. If you can live with the partially melted thing, then I highly recommend these truffles. Melted or not, they are still the best. Send me some un-melted ones next time to get 5 stars.",Best tasting truffles ever - just one problem

Well, like a dummy, I bought the deal.<br />So, perhaps the truth on Omaha Steaks: The sole stuffed with scallops and crab is really a shread of sole stuffed with a paste which I am hesitant to describe. It is not good to eat.<br />When our package arrived, we selected two filets mignon, two sole stuffed with scallops and crab, and four potatoes au gratin. The potatoes were edible.<br />The beef tenderloin was too thin to grill, but we grilled it anyway. Awful. I have already commented on the sole.<br />Still angry 12 hours later (color me stupid does not sit well with me!) I re-read all the information Omaha Steaks had sent us -- and conformed my suspicion that no where do these people state the grade of beef they sell.<br />The quality of the sole stuffed with scallops and crab is perhaps compatable with a very cheap diner on the interstate -- ""Well, you are hungry.

"summarize: I've tried a lot of natural peanut butters, and I've tried a few commercial peanut butters as well, but Krema beats all of them for both taste and texture.  When I can't find it locally, I buy it on Amazon, and when it's not available on Amazon, I buy it from Krema directly.<br /><br />Commercial peanut butters are jam-packed with sugar, salt, and hydrogenated oil; but the peanut butters you find at most health-food stores tell you exactly why these additions seem necessary.  They're thick, dull, and tasteless, as though somone had tossed a pound of peanuts into a food processor and stuffed the result into a jar.  Krema peanut butter is the vibrant exception.  It always tastes fresh, and it stays spreadable whether you refrigerate it or keep it on a kitchen shelf.<br /><br />When you first open the jar, the oil has worked its way to the top, and it takes a few minutes to stir it in, but you only have to do that once.  And it's worth every second of the time and effort.  I prefer the crunchy variety, but the smooth version is just as good, and, with the addition of soy sauce, cayenne, lemon, and brown sugar, makes the best sauce for Anglo-Indian dishes I've ever found.<br /><br />Be careful, however.  Another company named Krema also makes peanut butter, and their product isn't nearly as good.  The Krema company you want has its plant in Ohio and has been operating since 1898; their peanut butter is also sold under the name Crazy Richard's, which is exactly the same product, but was branded differently for markets on the west coast.",Best Crunchy Peanut Butter Out There
"summarize: Both of my dogs are in love with this product. They get so happy when I give it to them and drink it all up right away. Two of my cats enjoy it quite a bit, but my third cat wouldn't even try it. She sniffed it and walked away. I would definitely recommend this product as so many people feed their cats real milk, which is terrible for them. Cats are lactose intolerant! Feeding cats regular milk can (and usually will) cause loose bowels and real stomach discomfort. This stuff has lactose enzymes in it to help them digest it. Also, it often goes on sale at PetSmart for .99 cents or $1.19. Even at full price it's still relatively inexpensive. The only real negative comment I have is that if you don't use it within a few days of opening it, the spout gets all crusty and the milk at the bottom of the carton gets thick. It may still be fine to feed this to them in that condition, but I am paranoid and often end up throwing out half the carton because I don't use it quickly enough.The ingredients are awesome, actual real low-fat milk plus a digestive enzyme plus added taurine (an essential nutrient for cats).<br /><br />PS- MUCH better than the Whiskas CatMilk.

This time it came in frizzy and like a brillo pad. Not the whole head i lose about 1/4 each time so it is a mess. I washed my hair today after swimming to really give it a challenge.<br /><br />It lathers well and has a soft pleasant fragrance. Rinses out easily. I used the conditioner which I will also.<br /><br />It comes wrapped in plastic but mine leaked out into the bag so you have to kinda was the bottle, it was nice as a hand wash nothing wasted. It did not get the box wet.<br /><br />I will be buying this and the price here is less than the brand I buy at the big M store.<br />My hair is smooth and soft. Not all frizz gone but this is one use and it looks at least 75% better.",So very pleased with the product it is my new brand.
"summarize: This is more a review on the packaging, than the product.  When this was received the edge of the wrapper was torn along the top of the Reese's cup (keep in mind each cup is 1/2 a pound so they are large).  I think that this was due being delivered in an envelope and not a box. There was not adequate protection and when anything came into contact with the envelope it also came into contact with the product inside and therefore tore the package along the top edge of the Reese's cup.  I have requested a return label and I was told I would not be charged for the return, so at least that is one positive aspect of this situation.",Package was torn open when I received it
"summarize: My little one LOVES these smoothies and I feel great about offering them.<br /><br />Highlights:<br />1) Made from certified organic ingredients<br />2) Contains Calcium and Vitamin D<br />3) Large size-- each pouch contains over 4 ounces<br />4) Perfect container for toddlers and on-the-go... kiddos can hold it and feed themselves easily<br />5) No artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, or anything scary.<br /><br />A few reviewers have commented on the ""yogurt"" smell... well, this is exactly as described right on the pouch: YOGURT Smoothie. It is not disguised with artificial flavors. It is a healthy snack with pure, simple ingredients.

"summarize: My hair LOVES coconut oil, apparently.  I have been using a small amount in my hair after I wash and towel-dry my hair for the past 3 weeks, and my normally fine, dry hair is noticeably healthier.  It's not as frizzy and dry.  The coconut oil is actually changing my hair condition instead of just sitting on the surface of my hair and making it look glossy.<br /><br />I have tried some pretty expensive products in my hair ($20-$30 conditioners, hot oil treatments, etc.), and all I can say is, I am never going back.  My advice is to be patient with it, it's not an overnight cure, but your hair will definitely feel great over time.<br /><br />I also have pretty dry skin, but the oil seems to provide only minimal moisture for my cracked skin.  I'm sure it's great for normal skin, though.",Fantastic for hair.  OK for dry skin
"summarize: My daughter (toddler) Is allergic to dairy and soy. We tried goat's milk to no avail and have finally happily settled on Rice Dream Enriched Original. She loves it and Even I like the taste. It's a little sweet and she picked it right up after a year of breastfeeding. With the addition of a multivitamin each day, my pediatrician has approved it's use.<br /><br />We purchase the 64 ounce size for $3.24 at a local store (about $0.05 an ounce.) I came online to look for a better price when purchasing in bulk. The price for these small 8 ounce containers is $0.16 per ounce and causes MUCH more packaging waste. I appreciate the convenience of having it in a small package for dining out, etc... but It's just as easy to take an insulated sippy cup and be more environmentally conscious.<br /><br />The Rice Dream Website sells the 32 ounce size but their price is $0.10 an ounce, without shipping costs. Not much advantage to purchasing online so far. I was hoping that Amazon would have a decent cost on the larger sizes with free super saving shipping, because I could stop shopping at Wal-Mart entirely.<br /><br />I have contacted Amazon to request that they carry the larger 64 ounce size in cases. The first time I called, the Customer Service Rep<br />s computer locked up and she requested that I call her back. The second time I called I was told to leave feedback on the product and that all feedback is read by Amazon and that it could make a difference and might increase the chance that the product would be carried in a larger size, due to demand.","Excellent Product, Poor price and packaging options here"

"summarize: I bought this tea because it is supposed to have clinical proof that it lowers blood pressure.  I didn't realize that it would be so delicious!  It has a very fruity and tart taste, very similar to cranberry juice, without all the sugar.  Of course, you can add sugar if you like it less tart. I have found that it is best ice cold, although it is drinkable hot too.  The most amazing thing about this purchase is how huge the bag is. You can't really see that from the listing picture. It weighs a solid pound and is almost a foot tall.  SO much tea for the money, this is the best value for hibiscus tea that I have found.  Get it!","this bag is a fantastic value, and delicious too"
"summarize: Like most people I stumbled upon Nero at the gas station, looking for a healthier alternative to soda and energy drinks to give me a boost. That was many months ago, now I get two cases of this stuff delivered a month!  I've tried about five of Nero's flavors of drinks and Sonic is easily my favorite, it's got a tangy citrus taste (kinda grapefruit like) that is not only delicious but also quite healthy as it's packed with a lot of great vitamins and minerals that give you a healthy boost of energy, not a buzz.  I wouldn't go as far to say it really helps to stimulate the brain as it advertises, but it definitely does a better job at boosting energy and making you fell good than energy drinks and soda does.  I've also found myself losing a little weight, as I'd rather drink one of these than a soda and I seem to not be as hungry if I sip on this throughout the day, and at only 35 calories with minimal sugar it's the perfect drink alternative.  Now everyone complains about the price, but for me you can't really put a price on health.  Nero Sonic gives me the energy I need throughout the day, it's healthy, it's helped ween me off drinking a lot of soda, and in my opinon it tastes great.  Now I understand taste is subjective but if you can stomach the taste of energy drinks this is sweet nectar compared to most of those.  Sure you could just drink water and that might be even better for you, but water is boring and in my stressful daily life I need something with a little kick that I look forward to everyday, thankfully it's healthier than most sugary alternatives, and when I add up want I spent on sodas or energy drinks it's really not anymore costly.",The healthier alternative to soda and energy drinks.
"summarize: OK, the dog scarfs this down. But put a bowl of M&M's and a bowl of Broccoli in front of a child, and guess which bowl will be empty? It's the same with this.  I mix this with healthier food as filler. My dog is not that active, and all these carbs and fat would make for one fat puppy.  If, on the other hand, he was active and outside all the time, running around, etc. the carbs would burn off (same as for people!)  Fat is supposedly good for the dog's coat and skin.  So, if your dog is a finicky eater, fido will inhale this.  If you have an active dog, this is probably fine. If it's an indoor pet, this is better off as a mix-in, but not as a staple.<br /><br />There's no smell, and the food does not clump or stick. The bag is really sturdy - it's made of the same stuff as those blue tarps, so won't tear, and any opening you make won't spread.","Dog loves it, but nutritionally it's basically candy"
"summarize: I prefer deep, dark roasted coffees but many people don't.  My mother used standard household blends such as Folger's for many years.  When she received her Keuring machine she started to experiment with other brands and blends.  She occasionally drinks a flavored coffee but this has become her favorite.  I get her a couple of boxes a month and she loves it.  I have tried it and here is my take on this blend:<br /><br />The body (or ""mouth-feel"") is light to medium.  The acidity is medium-low so it won't have too much of a bite, especially of you use cream.  The flavor is surprisingly complex with some spice (maybe cardamom or anise and a little pepper) as well as a rich coffee finish.  This will not replace my favorite dark roasts but I will keep it on hand for those guests who find a ""Starbucks-type"" of coffee too strong or bitter.  If you, like my mother, enjoy a ""regular"" blend I don't think that it get's better than this.","A very nice, full flavored medium roast coffee"
"summarize: Lexie is a picky little dog. She doesn't like many brands of dog food, and turns down most offers of dog biscuits, etc.  But she eats the Beneful.  And that's good -- no dog food is healthy if the dog doesn't eat it.  She does eat certain shapes/flavors of bits first, but she eats them all.  They are smallish kibbles that would probably work for just about any size dog.<br /><br />But I wasn't thrilled to see that the main ingredient is corn.  I like that this food has both animal and vegetable ingredients, but would prefer to give Lexie more animal protein and less corn. (I consider corn a grain, not a vegetable, not something that dogs are designed to eat.)<br /><br />But given the price point, overall I think this is a reasonable choice.  3 stars from me, 5 stars from the dog = 4 stars.",Picky dog likes it; picky dog's people not impressed with ingredient list
"summarize: Make per directions and use half & half to top off for richer taste, maybe a little whipped cream topper and you have have a melt in the chair, soft spot, where visions of sugar plums and the like may begin to dance in your heads.  Yummy and so delicious.  I've purchased twice, first at near $13-each for two, then near $5-each for six of them - chalk it up to when you're buying!  I should make clear that I do not regret my initial purchase, I was merely showing an example when timing can play a part in the value of this kind of transaction.  Please allow me to elaborate that I initially selected Chadwell Retail sellers as I was trying the product, and it seemed reasonable given the value for two to select them to complete my purchase.  I have no qualms with the seller and would openly consider their services on this open market again as the purchase made sense.  Thank you for reading this far and for your consideration in advance.",Yummy and warm in my tummy!!!
"summarize: LOL Don't be intimidated by all these exotic Goya products, the company<br />is actually the oldest and most revered of all the commercial Spanish foods<br />companies and Chimichurri can best be described as Argentine Pesto.<br /><br />This is my favorite Chimichurri sauce, and its properly made with olive oil.<br />But not just any olive oil....Spanish Extra Virgin Olive Oil and in my book<br />it just doesn't get any better than that. (note: avoid similar products made<br />with vegetable oil)<br /><br />Following the traditional recipe, this makes a delicious dressing for any<br />grilled meat including burgers and sausages. But where this really shines<br />is as a marinade rather than a finisher. This has a tangy herbaceous flavor<br />and you will taste the blend of garlic, parsley, onion, olive oil, apple cider<br />vinegar, oregano and white pepper. Want more flavor, add your own herbs or<br />garlic but I think this blend is perfect right out of the jar.<br /><br />It can also be used as a spread with bread or to add a boost to vegetables,<br />salads and soups. And while mainly used for steak, this stuff works really<br />well on fish and grilled shrimp too or for making Bruchetta, or even just<br />with cheese and crackers. Its very versatile and you will find any number<br />of uses for this terrific concoction.<br /><br />IMO, this is the Heavyweight Champ of commercial Chimichurri sauces.","OK, this is not a Jewish company alright?"
"summarize: I am gluten free and vegan AND I have a sweet tooth BUT I'm trying to avoid eating too much sugar.  It's a dilemma! I like to have a few cookies with my coffee or tea and these fit the bill.  They don't have a lot of sugar but they are still sweet enough to feel like you're having a treat.  The label bills them as having fiber but they don't have as much as you would think.  Still, I'm not eating them for fiber's sake but as a snack.<br /><br />Another thing I do like about these is that they can be used to make a really nice gluten free cookie crust for pies.  It's hard to find a gluten free cookie crust but I found griding these up in the processor, mixing them with some melted butter and baking in a pie pan sets up a great crust for key lime pie, etc.  So I'm making the most of these little cookies!<br /><br />I didn't give them 5 stars because they're a bit pricey but I would buy them again.",Nice not so sweet gluten free vegan tea biscuit
"summarize: Long story short, I think my puppy is allergic to WHITE rice, which is ironic because that is what everyone tells you to feed your puppy when she has diarrhea. The situation got so bad I took her to the vet. Just want consumers to be aware of this possibility, that upgrading to premium dog food doesn't automatically mean better health for your dog! I've switched to another premium brand that has brown rice (which this does too) but not white rice. There was an *immediate* difference. (There were two other dog foods involved before and white rice was the major difference between the ones that upset my puppy's stomach and ones that didn't.)<br /><br />I wanted to give 1 star, but to be fair, the problem with the food was interaction between it and my puppy in particular, so I'll split the difference.",I'm sure it's great quality but gave my puppy runs (not due to switching foods either!)
"summarize: I love this litter box.  It lets me finish my most dreaded chore (cleaning six litter boxes for four cats) in only a few minutes.  And since the chore now has less dread associated with it, I'm likely to do it more often (like I'm supposed to), which makes it easier still (and makes for happier kitties!).  I dread cleaning every litter box other than these, so I'm in the process of replacing all of our litter boxes with this type.<br /><br />My only major complaint is that I can't find it (or something like it) in an extra large size, and one of our cats really needs an extra large litter box (he sometimes misses when he uses the smaller boxes).<br /><br />Is it something you should buy?  I don't know.  Please read the other (less positive) reviews.  The complaints that others have are real.  My wife has similar complaints, and doesn't really like these boxes.  But it's my job to clean the kitty litter, so this is my review.  ;-)  I've dealt with a couple of mechanical self-cleaning litter boxes in the past, and keeping them clean was far more of a hassle than this litter box.<br /><br />One reviewer mentioned that ""tipping it over even a large trash receptacle is awkward and messy.""  I have a different approach: once the litter has been sifted, I place the tray (with the waste) into the empty pan, and place the entire thing into the mouth of a large garbage bag before pouring it out.  There's no mess at all with this strategy.<br /><br />The slots in the sifting pan *do* get clogged if your cat pees a lot.  I solve this by banging the tray and empty pan against the wall or floor a couple of times (while inside the garbage bag), and it always gets out the wet litter.  It also helps if you put a thin layer of baking soda on the bottom after most cleanings (before adding back the litter).  Since the large clumps wet litter is less likely break up while sifting with this tray than when sifting with a scoop, the litter also stays cleaner for longer.<br /><br />A minor complaint: the swinging door is flimsy and was both too stiff (so the cats tended to avoid that box) and it kept falling off, so I just pulled it off.<br /><br />I haven't used the ""Omega Paw Self Cleaning Litter Box"" (probably linked under ""What Do Customers Ultimately Buy After Viewing This Item?"").  But I'll be buying one of those soon, to compare, because they have such positive reviews.",a must have for owners of many cats
"summarize: I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack.  This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word ""Bold"" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a ""Bold"" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion. This is still a good flavor and I like them but not love them!",A good flavor but not bold in comparison to some of the other flavors and more salt!
"summarize: I've always had a soft-spot for pasta and cheese because when I was raising my six children it was an easy, economical solution for a quick meal that they all liked. For some reason unknown to adults, kids do tend to like pasta and cheese in all its variations much better than adults do. I used to prepare the macaroni and cheese (no hamburger) for them with a salad and a half sandwich or a plain burger. Simple and easy...<br /><br />Ease of preparation is one of the reasons I got this product. The other reason is that when I saw the burger bits on the package it reminded me of good ol' juicy cheeseburgers that I loved in my younger days. Even though I don't eat them now, there was a time when I scarfed those cheeseburgers down...with big slices of raw onion. Yummy! Anyway, this dish blends together in a taste reminiscent of a cheeseburger and is very tasty.

"summarize: Are these really gluten free, because they sure don't taste like it!  There are a few other cookies being marketed as ""gluten free"" or ""diet"" but there simply is no comparison to these nuggets of goodness.  Frankly, even given the choice between these and something like a Pillsbury or Toll House oven-baked cookie, I'd take Lucy's cookies in a heartbeat.  No guilt, no high glycemic index to make you feel like you just gained five pounds, no impulse to hibernate.  Just moist, sweet morsels that make you wonder why the bag isn't three inches deeper.  (Seriously, Lucy, you need to make them deeper.)  And the inspiring story behind the creation of Lucy's cookies will make you feel that much better, knowing that you're supporting a homegrown business, rather than a huge multi-national.  I can't recommend these enough.","Good grief, these cookies are delicious!!!!"
"summarize: I hadn't had Spam since I was a kid - at least 25 years.  My mother had lived in Hawaii, where it is a very common food (even in restaurants) and used to feed it to us on occasion.  I remember liking it in the same way I enjoy fried ham and bacon.<br /><br />Still, as an adult, the idea of most canned meat just revolted me, not to mention the fact that within most of the US culture Spam is associated with poverty.  I recently got the idea to buy some when we were about to go camping in a remote location with no electricity or running water.  I didn't want to only eat peanut butter sandwiches and cup o' noodles - I wanted something heartier, and canned foods are the way to go!  While camping, I made a ""spam hash"" - spam cut into tiny pieces and cooked in olive oil along with some canned diced potatoes.  On a cold morning, along with some coffee, it really hit the spot.<br /><br />I now keep a few cans in my cupboard, and eat it at home at times.  I think the key for people who don't like Spam, or who are trying it for the first time, is to cut it into thin slices and fry it until crispy.  The texture of uncooked Spam is somewhat spongy and paste-like at the same time.  This can turn a lot of people off.  If you fry thick slices, the slices will still remain quite soft, even if the outside is crispy.  The uninitiated (as well as many of the initiated) would probably love Spam if it were cooked until crispy all the way through - hence the need for thin slices.  You end up with something hearty and delicious, like thick bacon.  With a fried egg, or some hashbrowns, it makes a delicious breakfast.<br /><br />I'm not advocating consumption of Spam on a regular basis.  Even the lite version is relatively high in fat and sodium. But, that's no different from bacon, another item to be enjoyed on occasion but not every day.<br /><br />If you genuinely don't like Spam, that's fine.  Not everyone likes every food.  But if you put it down because everyone thinks it's for ""poor people,"" then I suggest that you stop caring so much what other people think, and eat it if you will enjoy it.  The number of people who will eat any number of other processed foods but will disparage Spam is high.",I must admit it is delicious... Great for camping!
"summarize: I just love the fact that I can order Watkins Products from Amazon, at a very reasonable Price. The quality is still there, just as it was when I was a kid, and my mom purchased it from the Watkins man when he made his monthly trips to the rural areas of Arkansas.<br /><br />I especially love the size of the bottles a full 8 ounces. Much larger than the traditional size that you find in the grocery stores. The flavor really does come thru in baked products. I also used the Watkins 8 oz. Orange Extract in the recipe  I made for  TRIPLE ORANGE BUTTER CAKE By Lady Rose. It was full of Orange and Butter flavors, and was so moist and tasty. Head over to Just a Pinch Recipe Club, and check out the ingredients I used and to view a picture of this recipe that I created. I am sure you will be just as impressed with the recipe using Watkins products as my neighbors & I was. It really adds lots of FLAVOR TO ANY RECIPE. A little of it goes a long way when it comes to stretching flavor.<br /><br />I AM JUST SO EXICITED THAT I CAN ORDER FROM AMAZON and get my merchandise in a few days.  I have also used their Peppermint Extract, also in 8 ounces. Watkins and Amazon are a GREAT TEAM TOGETHER, bringing quality ingredients that we know and love at exceptional prices.

"summarize: I got two of these based on the wonderful reviews they got.  I have an 11 month old German Shepherd and an 11 month old Labrador Retriever.  They both chew up everything!!  Normal rawhide chews, the 12"" ones, last maybe an hour.  Their toys are destroyed, except for that wonderful Kong Ball.  They ate their doghouse, even after I put chicken wire around all the corners.  I didn't know what else to do.  I've read that getting them something to chew on will curb this bad behavior so I opted for two of these rings.  They were completely gone in a day and a half.  I don't know what the previous reviewers meant when they said they had dogs that were incredible chewers.  Anyway, I will buy them more for Christmas, because they do last the longest out of all the treats they've had.  I sure wish I could find something to entertain them for a week!",Didn't last as long as I had hoped.
"summarize: Frey Lemon & Black Pepper Dark Chocolate has not been available locally for several years. Nor could I find a supplier online. So I signed up for the Cachet brand thinking it couldn't be too different. Wrong! Whereas the Frey brand was beautifully balanced, the Cachet version has a very strong dried lemon taste and the pepper burn lingers far too long. I've never experienced any food with such large, hard chunks of pepper. Really, this should not be allowed without a warning to watch out for the pits! The thing I love about the Frey Lemon Pepper Chocolate is that you can't really identify lemon or pepper, just an unique flavor explosion. And then you realize it was lemon. And pepper.","Love lemon pepper chocolate, but not this version"
"summarize: Rev. Sylvester Graham created the original Graham crackers as part of a diet based on the theory ""that one could curb one's sexual appetite by eating bland foods."" [Wikipedia; ""Graham cracker"" accessed 21 MAR 2011].<br /><br />These crackers are true to the spirit of Rev. Graham's intent.  They are devoid of flavor, and possess the texture of the most delicate particle board.  While nutritious in the strictest sense, there is a surprising amount of salt (130mg or 5% of the ""daily value"" per 28 grams of cracker).  While not noticably salty, it baffles me why they bothered to add salt when they had clearly passed on any other flavor.<br /><br />And eating even one suppressed any urge to take pleasure in life.<br /><br />Don't bother, unless these are going to be used as some form of punishment.<br /><br />E.

"summarize: I use Just Like Sugar in baking and to sweeten my coffee and tea.  There is not the overwhelming sweetness of sucrose here, but it's to be expected and I'm not surprised by it.  I actually prefer a milder level of sweetness, and this product perfectly sweetened my homemade brownies, a wonderful compliment to the unsweetened chocolate I used.  I will use the white baking Just Like Sugar in all of my recipes, but avoid the Brown variety whose acrid aftertaste I could not tolerate.  The white is a winner, and so powdery fine that I don't need to put in a blender so that it will properly dissolve in mixtures, as I've had to do with other sugar substitutes on the market.  No digestive concerns noted.  The fiber in this sugar seems to be well tolerated. Will definitely be purchasing more.",Better than sugar in just about every way.
"summarize: I like coffee and my wife likes coffee.  Despite the fact that we were warned, starting at a very early age, that coffee would ""stunt our growth"" and do all kinds of horrible things to our growing little bodies, both of us starting drinking coffee at a very early age.  No, it did not stunt our growth or have any of the other horrid side effects on us in later life.  It did, when I was a wee one, make me rather hyper but I suspect I would have been that way anyway. I have always been in a state hovering between that of giant tree sloth and a crazed ferret...depending on what day of the week it is seemingly.<br /><br />Anyway, as things stand now we still drink quite a lot of coffee with two large pots being consumed daily.  To be quite honest, over the years we have been more inclined to purchase what ever brand was on sale at the time although our two old stand-bys have always been Folgers and Maxwell House.  Of the two, this Folgers French grind (Dark or Medium Dark) probably has the edge over the rest...when we can get it.  Both of us simply like the flavor better.<br /><br />Now that being said and truth be told, the breaking point as to whether or not you like a certain brand of coffee greatly depends upon what you get use to.  I know full well that many swear by the process of buying their own beans, grinding their coffee to suit their taste and proceeding from there.  I do not doubt for a second that this is good coffee...I have had coffee prepared this way many times and it is indeed good.  For us though, the process of going through this, the extra cost of having a quality coffee grinder, the time involved and the extra cost of the truly fresh coffee beans, simply is not worth the trouble...that is just us though and our particular life style.<br /><br />No, we will stick to this stuff and the Maxwell House.  It is what we are use to; it is what we enjoy.  We will switch from on to the other, depending which is on sale at the time.  I must say, the cost of this coffee here on Amazon, if you belong to one of the free shipping programs, is quite attractive and quite competitive.<br /><br />I also like the empty plastic containers and have dozens of uses for them around the house.<br /><br />And no, we did not let our children or grandchildren start drinking coffee at an early age...we feared that it would stunt their growth and do horrid things to their growing bodies.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great product and meets our needs perfectly.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks",ONE OF OUR OLD STAND-BYS.

"summarize: This is a challenging review because it is a product for an important member of the family, our 13 year old dog.<br /> As she has aged, she has come to prefer moist canned food and we balance it with dry to help her teeth, breath and overall diet.<br /><br />I find I agree that "" Chef Michael's Sirloin Steak"" product does appear to be candy-like  for dogs. The product, while seemingly liked, does seem to be varied in overall value when one looks at the total  ingredients.  A product called "" Chef Michael's Sirloin Steak"" does sound balanced, but the bag content shows a large amount of soy and corn and by-products.  Other reviewers have commented on the specifics of what many of those by-products actually contain, and it gives one pause.<br /><br />I do wonder why the product has ""added colors"" as I was always told dogs were color blind, which implies a marketing spin rather than a quality perspective. One must understand the spin to the ones who make the actual purchase.<br /><br />The positives:  dogs seem to like the product and beef (as contrasted with fillers and by products) is listed as the #1 ingredient<br /><br />The negatives:  the supplementary fillers, a less than great aroma and the cost at $2.20+ per pound makes one need to evaluate<br /><br />Dr. John Hogan CHA CHE CMHS<br />HospitalityEducators<br />Hogan Hospitality",Perhaps the dog must be the one who decides?
"summarize: NIDO INSTANT DRY WHOLE MILK POWDER seemed the answer to the prayers of anyone with a too-small-for-their-needs-refrigerator-and-who-can't-afford-to-presently-purchase-a-new-refrigerator -- like me.  I've tried non-fat dry milk to save room in my refrigerator --but the taste is AWFUL!  I've tried to substitute sweetened condensed milk, (too sweet), and 1/2 and 1/2, (which needs refrigeration -- but not that much room in the refrigerator.  OK -- but no Vitamin D!  Nido Instant Dry Whole Milk Powder, though expensive, seemed just want I wanted -- and, though expensive, is not as expensive as buying a new refrigerator!<br /><br />The taste of NIDO is much better than non-fat dry milk.  And for most purposes, works quite well.  But somehow, when I try to use it with coffee -- and Splenda -- the sweetness of the Splenda is lessened.  I like sweet coffee -- but putting 3 or 4 times my usual amount of Splenda to achieve the sweetness I like in coffee could be dangerous.<br />(My doctor has already told me to cut down, as too much Splenda seems to be bad for the liver.) I suspect that the LECITHIN in NIDO is what gets in the way of the sweetness, as lecithin is NOT found in most liquid whole milks, (that I know of, anyway).  So my advice would be to use NIDO in anything that does not require too much sweetness, (sweentess from Splenda, and/or sucralose, at any rate.)  But if you don't require too much sweetness in your coffee, it's OK to use, I guess.  And it can always be used, if an emergency strikes and your refrigerator stops working.",F L A V O R.....O K....E X C E P T....I N....C O F F E E
"summarize: I first switched to this food for my senior cats who both had cancer (most likely from my feeding them cheap food all their lives - never again). Within days of starting my cancer-cats on this food they both perked up, gained weight, and actually maintained the last few months of their lives in an active and normal manner. Both of course finally succumbed to cancer, but even the vet was surprised at how long they lived after diagnosis, and how brief the period of their final decline was (they both sort of bottomed out within a two day period at the end).<br /><br />Now, the other piece: I had purchased another Siamese upon learning of my other cats' illness, and he not only loved them, he also loved the Natural Balance food, which was all he got. I noticed that as he grew he was not anemic looking as most siamese are, but actually had good muscle tone. When I brought him for his first vet checkup the vet said, and I quote ""In 20 years, this is the healthiest looking Siamese cat I have ever seen."" She commented on his physique, muscle tone, activity level, coat, etc. I later adopted a Tabby the same age as the Siamese, and got the same response. Both cats just have sleek, beautiful coats, are very athletic and energetic, and love the Natural Balance food.<br /><br />I firmly believe that this food (and I now also use Blue Buffalo Wilderness for some variety) has made a real and noticeable differnce in the health and quality of life of my cats, and I highly recommend it to anyone. I will say my cats don't care for the wet Natural Balance foods, so I supplement their diet with an occasional Fancy Feast flavor that is free of glutens and fillers (you can Google for the list. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Addendum 4/12/10: My cats have changed their minds about the NB wet food and really enjoy it now. The key is to switch around the flavors.<br /><br />Addendum 4/22/11: have since adopted two more shelter cats, one a snowshoe siamese, the other a sable burmese. After each being on Natural Balance for about five months, the Snowshoe has a fur coat that is silky and beautiful; the little Burmese has a sleek shiny coat. Both have loads of energy. Again the vet was amazed at their coats and muscle tone, as was the vet tech.",Outstanding Food for both healthy and sick cats
"summarize: I have a special grinder just for red peppers. I grind them up and put them on pizza, pasta, whatever.  Grinding them seems to make them a bit hotter but that's besides the point. I bought these because regular crushed red peppers weren't doing it for me anymore. I got these things in the mail and pulled off the seal under the cap(away from my cat who seemed very interested in them). There was a fine dust on the underside of the seal so I decided it was fine to try the peppers that way.<br /><br />I licked my pinky finger, took a dab of the pepper dust, and put it on my tongue.  The taste was a lot different than I expected, a strong, smoky flavor but not entirely great tasting. I suppose as a spice it would get the job done but it doesn't taste like jalapeno or peperencini or anything.  About 5 seconds in, I experienced the most severe burning sensation in my mouth in my life. These things are crazy hot, not for the faint of heart, and after a few hours recollecting my experience, I've come to the conclusion that these peppers are a great way to ruin food.  Certainly worth the money. Be very careful with these bad boys.",Hey these are a little bit spicy!
"summarize: I'd definitely see if there's a health food store that gives samples, or an organic restaurant that carries this, or a friend with it--try it before buying.<br /><br />I was used to French's and Heinz's yellow--staples in my fridge along with Grey Poupon and Gulden's. But I have been, in the last year, switching to organic products and produce. I purchased this to replace my about to expire French's yellow mustard.<br /><br />Well, this stuff is awful. I don't know why it has that odd taste--the vinegar, the particular mustard seeds?--but I put this on a sandwich and hated it. Then I decided to try again, a different day, and again, scraped it off the turkey. I could not bear it.<br /><br />I threw the nearly full bottle away.<br /><br />For now, it's back to non-organic mustard until I can taste other organic mustards and find one that doesn't make me wanna spit out my food.<br /><br />Pity.<br /><br />Mir","Dreadful.

"summarize: My husband's officemates take turns providing coffee for the machine. He took this in for his turn (without telling them anything about it) and probably half the office commented how good it was and asked where he got it--and requested he bring that variety again. So it looks like this will be a regular purchase for us.<br /><br />Direct from hubby: A very smooth and robust tasting coffee. I prefer the stronger varieties and this one does not disappoint! The first pot I mixed as I normally do for a new coffee, wow intense! I then backed down to a normal mix and enjoyed the pot more. I highly recommend this coffee to anyone that is seeking the deep, robust taste of a European coffee.","It was a hit at the office! Deep, robust taste!"

""You've got to be kidding.""  Anyway, I prefer slightly vinegar-y sauces rather than sweet, and the spices in this are OUTSTANDING.

"summarize: If you are like me, chances are that you've eaten a lot of Girl Scout cookies over the years, and if you are like most GSA cookie buyers, your favorites are the famous <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D7TPZS"">Girl Scout Thin Mint Cookies</a>.

"summarize: We have three cats, the youngest is about eleven years old, another is fifteen and our oldest is, well ancient.  That is what the vet told us ten years ago.  The youngest is a blob.  When he lays down, he looks like a footstool. The other two are arthritic and skinny.<br /><br />Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs, I figured that we'd give it a try for our cats.  I'd had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problems.<br /><br />Buster, the youngest, is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats.  However, the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really ""feeling better"" since we changed their food to Felidae.  Even Prissy, the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her, where before when she was on Purina One, all she wanted to do was to sleep.<br /><br />I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems, it'll be more effective.<br /><br />However, the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life.",Great For Fat Cats and Senior Citizens
"summarize: Alpine Spiced Cider is a great instant cider blend. Many quick, powdered drinks are one-note, but this one isn't. It manages to be both sweet and tart like real apple cider, and has just a hint of cinnamon and mulled spice in the background. During long, cold winters, it's so nice to have a fast treat like this cider to help warm you up inside.<br /><br />Because these have a good amount of Vitamin C, they are also excellent for the inevitable winter colds. On those horrible days when even opening and heating a can of chicken soup seems too hard, all you have to do is switch your electric kettle to on, dump the packet into a cup and you're good to go. Maybe a cup of apple cider a day can even keep the doctor away, who knows?<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the Alpine Spiced Cider Drink Mixes as a quick and easy way to enjoy a hot beverage. It won't be as authentic as homemade cider, but it won't be a hassle to prepare either.","Balance of Sweet, Tart and a Hint of Spice"
"summarize: I was excited to try the Brooklyn corner donut shop.  When I got the package, it was like Christmas - I tore open the box and made my 1st cup.  I really enjoyed the coffee.  Great flavor...  NOW...  jump forward to today... I wasted 4 pods and was unable to produce a cup.  The pod would fill with water, I could hear the machine trying to brew and nothing... actually water would trickle but it was full of grinds...  I was unable to produce a cup of coffee this morning - what gives; I was under the impression the issues were corrected?!?!?

"summarize: I've tried for years and years to like stevia, but it's always left a funky aftertaste in my mouth that just ruined it's use for me. Until now, the most tolerable of the stevias was the vanilla cream by sweetleaf, but even that left the funky after taste.<br /><br />A few months ago I decided to go on a marathon stevia taste test adventure and bought almost every brand out there to give them each a go. I didn't have high expectations as I fully expected them all to leave me with the funky taste. I did not do truvia, because it has another added sweetener - it is not pure stevia. I only tested those that were pure stevia plain flavor and vanilla flavor (since the sweetleaf vanilla had been the best one so far).<br /><br />I was shocked beyond belief when using the stevia in the raw and not having any funky after taste! I tried it many different ways - in chai tea, to sweeten hot breakfast cereal, for baking and cooking sweet treats, etc. and no aftertaste! I also tried larger quantities, as sometimes the more you use the increased after taste. So far no matter what I've done with this stevia I've had NO aftertaste what-so-ever!!!<br /><br />If you've tried to like stevia and just can't get past the after taste then give stevia in the raw a go - I think you'll be very surprised and pleased as I've been.

"summarize: I'm a guy with hairy arms and hairy legs. Until I found this stuff, I was using various other body washes with my loofah. I always felt like I could never get enough suds and that the application seemed rough and difficult to quickly spread the body wash all over. Since I started using this stuff (for a few years now), I haven't looked back. This stuff is nice and soft and can create a decent amount of suds with somewhat minimal amounts of application on the loofah. It goes on smooth and ends up making my skin nice and smooth. And it rinses off nice, without leaving my skin rough. It works well, has a nice subtle smell, and I won't use anything else.",I'm a man. I love this stuff.
"summarize: I like these bars because you get the crunch and flavor of a nut bar without too much sugar. They are peanut-y, without the weird texture and gross sweetness of other peanut butter protein bars. In my mind these are positives.<br /><br />Be prepared that there is not likely to be a large amount of chocolate coating on any given bar. The first time I bought one, I was disappointed when I opened it and compared the appearance of the actual bar to the picture on the packaging. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the taste so I decided to buy more.<br /><br />They can sometimes leave an impression of being a bit dry or gritty, which I suppose is due to the soy crisps or tapioca starch, or maybe just how dry my own mouth happens to be that day. I simply make sure I have a glass of water available when I plan to eat one of these.",Good crunch and not too sweet
"summarize: There are some products that make our lives better, and some that make us happy, and this does both for me. It's on my list of things that make me happy. Seriously.<br /><br />I love Passion iced tea at Starbucks. I always get it unsweetened with ice.<br /><br />I had one of those moments (after handing nearly five dollars to the barista for just one glass of this stuff) and I thought, ""You know, if I could have a bunch of this at home, I'd up my water intake, and I bet my kids would love it.""<br /><br />And I was right. I drink it and so does my husband three kids. Its refreshing, a little tart, and just a nice break from water. No sugar, no additives, and that makes it feel healthy.<br /><br />I started with the regular sized bags and found 6 bags per gallon works. I boiled a half gallon of water, let it steep, then added extra water in the pitcher until it hit the gallon mark.<br /><br />I bought a new gallon pitcher here at amazon to cut down the amount of times I made tea, and when I found the gallon sized iced tea bags were available, I was thrilled. One bag per gallon is perfect for us. I know there are those out there who want it stronger and tarter, but I have two reasons. One, it saves money by using less and honestly, if I let it steep for a long time--- leaving the bag in the pot for an hour or two until it cools--- it's plenty strong.<br /><br />It's a big hit with guests, too. People are so pleasantly surprised when I offer them a cold glass of passion tea.",I'm a Starbucks Passion Iced Tea addict...and finally found my fix.

I have a two year old, so we always have a stock of chocolate chip granola bars, but even though they were convenient for a mom in grad school, I wanted something more mature.  These are wonderful.

"summarize: My 4 year old son has mild autism and many of his symptoms are controlled with a GFCF diet (he also has a dairy sensitivity). When we first started it, I felt awful because he LOVES milk. I bought this as a way to transition, and he chugged it like he'd never had a drop to drink! LOL My 1.5 year old also LOVED it. We've tried several varieties and all of them have been a hit. It's a little too pricey for us to use as a complete substitute (we use almond milk), but I often pick it up as a treat or for when they feel icky. AWESOME, kid friendly product that I would highly recommend!","Great for Gluten-free, Dairy-free kid's diets!"
"summarize: The chocolate melted amazingly quickly and evenly. So much easier than cocoa or baker's chocolate with fats, etc, in a double boiler! Just put them in a microwave safe bowl, zap em, and set out some parchment paper for easy clean-up of the dipped items.<br /><br />However, it is much sweeter than other dark chocolates. Certainly it is sweeter than I would have preferred.<br /><br />In addition, the bottom of the container had broken just as I lifted it out of the box in which it had been mailed - it was extremely thin, thinner than the lid, and the sides are sharp and basically cut the bottom in a circular pattern. So the remainder is now in Tupperware and luckily I caught it before too much fell out.","Melted quickly, evenly - but very sweet, bad packaging"
"summarize: I am admittedly a big fan of Barry Farm products.  They make just about any food, veggie, dairy product, or spice in either a freeze dried or powdered form.  As an outdoor enthusiast that enjoys carrying along a little taste of home into the savage wilderness, this is a company that I am well familiar with.  Not everything they make is delicious, or worth it. My experience with them however is that most of their products are just about the finest, and many times the only ones around.  This cheddar cheese powder is definitely one of their best.  Many reviewers here mention making macaroni and cheese, and popcorn with it.  Although I have used it for those purposes like everyone else, I have also used this powder as an addition to many soups that call for cheese, or grated cheese. (It makes a very flavorful substitute for grated cheese in many recipes.) Hamburger and sausage soups are a good example.  Many times I have concocted delicious one pot meals using this powder while out in the wilds on a hike, or camping. They are remembered as some of the best meals I have ever had. It is also very good when sprinkled on home made pizza, and I have an excellent recipe that includes this powder, butter, flour, and salt, that makes a delicious cheese spread for crackers and super bowl parties. Barry Farms cheddar powder is strong and flavorful, and a little goes a long ways.  A one pound bag will get you through many a recipe and outdoor adventure.  However since the shipping on this is a little high, (and the powder so reasonable) I suggest buying two pounds or more at once and storing it in a good air tight container.  You will save a lot on the shipping, and this powder will last for months if stored correctly.  I highly recommend this cheddar powder for those that enjoy the simple pleasures of popcorn and mac and cheese, as well as the more adventurous among us in the kitchen, and over an open fire...","Excellent, With A Variety Of Uses.."
"summarize: I was looking for a meal supplement bar that is high in protein (16g) and fiber (4g). This fit the bill, and it's also (relatively) low on carbs (10) and calories (150).<br /><br />The lemon coconut flavor was a nice change from most protein bars' chocolate or peanut butter. It has the consistency something like a rice-krispie treat. It's nice that it's NOT coated in chocolate that melts and makes eating at your desk a mess.<br /><br />The only knock on these bars is the price. At about $2 per bar, it's one of the priciest on the market. I've never found a bar with higher protein and fiber at 150 calories; but I've found some that come close. The ""close"" ones are about half the price too. I really liked the Simply bars and I'm keeping an eye out for sales. When buying 3 boxes (45 bars) doesn't cost $100 I'll definitely buy again.","Great taste, good nutrition, but a bit pricey"

"summarize: The title says it all for me. I wanted these for baking! If they don't tell you, or you couldn't tell from the photo, these are MINI-CHOCOLATE CHIPS! My bags didn't have the words ""Mini Chips"", and no picture, so the manufacturer is in the process of learning/updating. They taste good/fine/chocolately when you eat them out of the bag. But, when you bake them into cookies, be prepared to make a smaller batch(use less flour, etc.), or use more than one bag! I was REALLY disappointed! I couldn't taste them at all! Because of how they tasted in hand, I thought they would be fine, but most recipes call for 2 cups chocolate chips = 1 bag of chocolate chips. Those are 12 oz bags. These are 10 oz bags.  Who measures?? Well, I didn't measure. I think if I had used maybe 1 1/2 to 2 bags it might of been okay.<br /><br />Okay, so I didn't react soy-wise, but.... what's the good of being rid of the reactive element if you get rid of the flavor and enjoyment at the same time?! I might as  well done plain cookies in that case! Or shortbread, then I wouldn't of expected chocolate-chip flavor, ya know?!?<br /><br />If you can find the ""right"" bag of Dagoba (Organic Chocolate) Chocodrops 73% cacao content, in the baking section, read the label [one bag HAD soy lecithin; the other one from another store didn't-of course I bought it, and they really didn't have the soy lecithin, how odd. April 2011], they are a much better choice, choco chip size-wise. The Dagoba's were an accident find. Unfortunately, these are only 8 oz. (not 12), but the flavor stands up to the baking. You probably want to add vanilla to complement. * I got mine from Whole Food's Market. This isn't something you typically find at Safeway or Lucky's Market, FYI.<br /><br />I will make it a point to re-bake using two bags and see what happens and add a comment","No soy.

"summarize: I've had these noodles many, many times. From grocery stores, and even a small convenience store on my college campus. They are always SUPERB- some of the best microwavable cuisine I've eaten. The noodles are soft, the sauce is like a syrup, and the flavor is just unbelievable.<br /><br />Not from amazon. I purchased these noodles with high hopes. I've ordered food items before from Amazon and NEVER have they arrived to my satisfaction or expectations. With these, I figured- ""Hey, how could they possibly screw up vacuum sealed microwavable noodles?"" I still couldn't tell you how, but it definitely happened.<br /><br />The noodles were clumpy, and broke even after microwaving , even if a small bit of water was added- nothing. There was no life to them, and when your noodles are off- it's tough to enjoy a noodle dish. If that had been the end of it, though, I still would have tolerated the rest of my 6-pack, if vowing to never order them from Amazon again. But no, somehow the SAUCE managed to be terrible in this product! Rather than the viscous syrup-texture of the store-bought Annie Chun's, the packet included in this item was watery with clumps. The sauce itself was watery, yet the ""clumps"" were all the more noticable for lack of syrup around them. These ""clumps"" that do not exist in the grocery-store version refused to leave the packet without me opening it up and adding water, swirling, and then dumping out whatever one would call the ungodly mixture I had at that point.<br /><br />Even still- I had hope for the finished product. Surely Annie will pull through for me, regardless of where I got this particular package from! No. What emerged from my microwave took me by complete surprise. In sharp contrast to the delicious noodles resulting from the store-bought Annie Chun's was what can only be described as a disaster. The noodles, already rubbery rather than soft- dried and shriveled over their 60 seconds in the microwave. The sauce, rather than permeating through the noodles as it usually does- had slipped past and collected in a small pool at the bottom of the container. Vegetable chunks and the mysterious ""clumps"" shriveled and died as well, without the sauce buoying their transformation from freeze-dried to fresh.<br /><br />Three trials later, modifying this and that part of the instructions: soaking the noodles in warm water first, including water in the container before microwaving, mixing a bit of water and corn starch into the sauce, none of this could save what Amazon shipped to me as ""Annie Chun's Chinese Chow Mein"" noodles. In the end, I decided against leaving the remaining two bowls in the common room for ""someone"" to eat. I wouldn't want to turn them off this great product just because I made the mistake of ordering food off of Amazon. Instead, they made their way to the trash, where they belonged.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, this isn't the first time I've ordered food off of amazon- Emerald Nuts that were ""off"", peanut butter that was ""strange"", a pack of 6 jars of Nutella one of which was opened, another of which was just ""different"". Scooby-Doo gummies that arrived with a crusty/crunchy exterior, and now this pack of noodles. It's not the first time, but I can safely say that it will be the last. Amazon's cheap prices are great for some things, but for groceries- it's just not worth it to this buyer any longer.","These noodles are great, but not from Amazon."
"summarize: First: If you don't have the ball holder, don't bother with these. They aren't really ""everlasting"" in the ball, but they'll last you a whole lot longer (for most dogs) when inserted in the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012V1G0Y"">StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large</a>.<br /><br />Second: Make sure you get the right size for your dog. If you have a giant breed, this whole line isn't really for you. My 40lbs Aussie who is a moderate chewer, is about the large ball's limit and once she pops the treat out, the remainder is gone in less than 5 minutes. If you have a tiny dog, get the right size. They aren't going to be able to handle the large. They need to be able to gnaw at it, which they won't be able to do on the larger balls.<br /><br />Third: The liver discs SMELL. Well, they ALL smell, but these are pretty pungent. I try to make the dog play with it across the room, whereas the other flavors aren't nearly as off-putting.","Worst Smelling of the Lot, but the Dog Loves Them"
"summarize: If you're always on the look-out for a healthy, tasty and unusual chip, these may delight you.  One serving--13 chips or 1 oz.--provides one daily serving of vegetables.  Wow!  They have a bit of a sweet potato/carrot-salty taste although they're fairly low in sodium (only 6% of daily allowance.)  They have a bubbly light texture which is fun. Love the texture. They have no trans-fat and are all natural and cholesterol free and vegan.  The fat content is 11% which is okay--it's from pressed sunflower and canola oils.<br /><br />I love the taste of them--especially knowing they provide a serving of vegetables.  Other ingredients include dried potatoes, navy beans, rice flour, potato starch, carrot, sweet potato, maltodextrin, onion powder, garlic powder, konjac flour, citric acid and natural flavor.  They are a fun sorta crescent shape.  The back of the bag shows them being dipped in guacamole but I find there's enough flavor, I'm happy with them plain.<br /><br />They'd be great to serve at a party as they offer a unique taste, texture and are healthy.",35% of Vitamin A--a healthy & tasty snack!
"summarize: Blue Buffalo Spa Select is great! Top of the line ingredients, human food grade-- in addition to the indoor cat formula there's a chicken version and a fish version. This food meets a very high standard. No yucky meat ""by-products"", meat and meat meals are the top ingredients, plus a host of wholesome and varied ingredients and probiotics.<br /><br />On top of that, this is an incredibly palatable food. My cat LOVES it. In fact, she scarfs it right down, when she typically has just grazed on a piece or two at a time of other premium foods. I have to be careful to use a measuring cup and not overfeed her, 'cause she will seek me out and meow for more!<br /><br />Blue Buffalo uses a unique process to manufacture ""lifebits"" which are added to the food. These smaller, darker pieces are cold formed in order to maintain nutrients. I don't believe any other company incorporates this kind of element into cat or dog food.<br /><br />I came across this cat food at the local Tractor Supply. I'd never heard or read about Blue Buffalo, but I respect what they are doing, and I've changed to Blue Buffalo dog food for my golden retrievers, too.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's a summary of the nutritional information:<br /><br />-Recommended daily feeding chart-- amount varies based on age, activity level, breed, and environement, but in general a 5-9 pound cat will eat 1/4-1/2 cup, while a 10-14 pound cat will eat 1/2-1 cup.<br />-One cup contains 478 calories<br />-Major ingredients:<br />Deboned chicken, chicken meal, whole ground barley, fish meal, oatmeal, whole ground brown rice, whole potatoes, chicken fat (preserved with natural mixed tocopherols), natural chicken flavor, dried egg, dried cellulose, whole sweet potatoes, whole carrots, cranberries, blueberries, flaxseed (natural soource of Omega 6 fatty acids), barley grass, dried parsley, alfalfa meal, kelp meal, taurine, l-carnitine, l-lysine, ycca schidigera, green tea extract, turmeric, salmon oil (natural source of Omega 3 fatty acids), black malted barley, dried chicory root, fructooligosaccarides, oil of rosemary, the expected vitamins and minerals, and several probiotics (lactobacillus acidolphilus, bacillus subtilis, bifidobacterium thermophilum, bifidobacgterium longum, enterococcus faecium).<br /><br />I hope this helps you evaluate whether or not this food is a good match for your feline friend.

"summarize: I have curly hair; like seriously curly hair. Additionally, it gets all frizzy whenever it's even the least bit humid. I have tried deep cleansers and balms before so I thought that I would take a stab with this one. The first thing I noticed is that the smell was fantastic! I wanted to put a wick in it and burn it like a candle. The second thing I noticed is that it was very greasy to the touch. Previously, I have put balm in my hair while washing and waited 15 minutes or so and then washed it out. Other times, I have only used the products once my hair is clean and dry and I use it to style. I tried both of these ways and ended up with the same disaster on my hands: greasy, gross hair! You might ask why I tried both of these ways and didn't just read the instructions. Funny you should ask! There are no instructions or directions on the container....AT ALL. I looked everywhere and under all of the labels and found nothing.<br /><br />Therefore, I was left on my own to try to figure it out. When I put it in my hair while washing, it took almost a week to get my hair to stop feeling greasy. No matter how many times I wash it, it looked like I had dipped my head in a deep fryer. When I used it for styling, the same problem occurred!<br /><br />Maybe I am from another hair product planet, but all I can say is that you should pass on this product. That being said, I kept mine because I like the smell!","If I wanted hair this greasy, I just wouldn't wash it!"

"summarize: I was quite happy with how this product worked as a body wash, but I won't be buying it until the price comes down.  Given that every body wash that I've used has gotten me clean, my criteria for choosing one over another are pretty simple:  I want something with a pleasant scent, I want a product that isn't overly thin and watery, and I want to feel like I'm getting a good value.  This Dove body wash met the first two of those, so I give it a thumbs up in regards to performance.  The one balking point for me is that it costs about three times as much as the Suave men's body wash that I typically use, and I don't like it all that much more than the Suave.<br /><br />Overall, I gave it four stars.  Performance is a solid five stars, but value is closer to three stars, IMO.","Nicely scented with a good texture, but a bit expensive"

Complaints dropped off in late 2009 and for most of 2010, FDA says, but the agency is once again seeing a rise in cases.<br /><br />The agency is advising consumers who feed their dogs chicken-jerky products to watch for these clinical signs:<br /><br />* decreased appetite,<br /><br />* decreased activity,<br /><br />* vomiting,<br /><br />* diarrhea (sometimes with blood),<br /><br />* increased water consumption,<br /><br />* and/or increased urination.<br /><br />If the dog shows any of these signs, FDA says pet owners should stop feeding the chicken-jerky product. Pet owners should also consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours, FDA says.<br /><br />Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some adverse event reports have involved mortality.<br /><br />FDA says it is working with several animal health diagnostic laboratories to determine why the products are causing illness. Despite extensive chemical and microbial testing, FDA adds it has not been able to identify a contaminant yet.<br /><br />FDA is also asking veterinarians to report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or Click here<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've been awarding this ""Chicken Breast, Flaxseed & Vitamins"" strip of chicken jerky to my 25 pound mixed breed dog for over a year without any problem.

"summarize: My 5 pound chihuahua LOVES these.  She is definitely a power chewer, and this keeps her occupied for several hours.  When she was younger, it would last her days, so it could last a very long time, depending on your dog.  I just got another chihuahua puppy, and he loves these just as much, and they do a good job sharing and taking turns with it.  The only bad thing about these is that you better not need your dog to pay any attention to you.  My dogs become completely preoccupied with these for hours, and they don't pay any attention to me!<br /><br />I've tried other types of bully sticks (generic, I think), because sometimes this brand is hard to get, but they smell terrible!  The smell of some of the other brands makes me want to hurl. But these don't smell at all to me, so I am going to stick with Merrick Flossies.",Yummy! My favorite treat! And NO FOUL SMELL!!! =D
"summarize: I've used them all - saccharine, Sweet 'n Low, Equal, and Splenda.  None of these sweetners tasted like sugar, but with a family history of diabetes and obesity, I chose to make that trade-off.  Some of the sweetners were acceptable; some just didn't sweeten enough (Equal), using only one packet, to be cost effective.  Splenda has been my sweetner of choice for the past several years, but it still didn't taste like sugar.<br /><br />One of the warehouse stores was demonstrating PureVia, so my spouse and I tried it.  Imagine how surprised I was to find the taste and texture were as close to granulated sugar as I have encountered in a sweetner.  Even my picky spouse thought he could use this on his cereal in the morning - instead of several tablespoons of sugar.  I used PureVia in my coffee this morning.  PureVia was truly as close to sugar as I have found - one packet was sufficient and the coffee tasted great!  We did find that PureVia did not dissolve well in iced tea; again, it performed very much like sugar when that sweetner is put into cold tea.<br /><br />If you use some type of artificial sweetner, then you should definitely consider PureVia.  The per packet cost is higher than the other artificial sweetners when compared on a one-to-one basis.  For example and in my opinion, one packet of PureVia sweetens as much as one packet of Sweet 'n Low, three packets of Equal, and two packets of Splenda.  However, factoring in the requirement to use multiple packets of most of the other sweetners and the superior taste of PureVia, I think it is clearly the best sweetner available.  I will be switching to PureVia as my sweetner of choice and recommend it to anyone who also uses sweetners instead of sugar.",As Close to Sugar as It Gets...
"summarize: I found the Crystal Light Mojito Moctail to be pretty good.  Although it has the ""artificial sweetner aftertaste"", it is pretty slight - and this is from someone who avoids diet drinks like the plague.  Since I've never had a Mojito, I wasn't sure what to expect from the taste.  However, it was a very pleasant blend of Crystal Light's standard Lemonade with a hint of Mint and Lime.  My 7 and 10 yr old children were even able to independently tell me without coaching what added flavors were in the drink.  One said ""I taste something minty"" and the other said ""I think there's lime in here too"", so Crystal Light obviously did a good job on the blend.  They obviously also did a good job on the overall drink because my kids drank an entire pitcher while I was at work.

"summarize: I used to eat these every morning for breakfast when I had a 1+ hour commute in upstate NY.  They are quick and easy to grab, but must be consumed with liquid.  I preferred a hot cup of coffee and a glass of water to wash everything down.  They would last me until lunch time, which was nice since I was always running from one campus to another.  I had always jsut purchased a box a week from the local grocery store.<br /><br />Be aware, however, if you buy in bulk from Amazon: we purchased two six box cases (72 breakfast squares), which for 2 people should last 36 work days.  If you factor in a few days where you actually have time to make breakfast or just want something different, these should last 1.5-2 months.  I don't mind buying things this far in advance, and it's never been an issue, but the expiration date of these bars did not fall within that 2 month range.  Now, most food products in packaging that I've had experience with are good past the exp date.  These, however, were soooo dry and made me want to eat them even less.  Whereas before you needed a cup of coffee, water or tea, now it was essential to dip the bar or take a bite and then immediately a swig of beverage even before chewing.","Good for an OCCASIONAL breakfast on the go, beware of exp date"
"summarize: I decided to try these after reading a blurb about them in our newspaper.  It's hard to compare them to pretzels, other than the shape.  I'm so-so about pretzels (I find them boring), but these are anything but boring.  The crunch is absolutely addictive.  Even my husband, who is less than forgiving about ""healthy food that tastes too healthy"", loves them.  We bought a second bag at the grocery store (4.49 per bag) before deciding that buying them by the case (at 3.46 per bag) was definitely the way to go.  My only hesitation in doing so was wondering how far out the expiration dates would go.  I'm hoping that the expiration date on the shipment of 12 is at least 2 to 3 months in the future.  Don't let me down, Amazon!","Acquired taste, but oh so addictive."
"summarize: OMG! So the kids say these days. We just ordered these a week ago because my wife LOVES to bake, but can't eat wheat products anymore. I ordered these for her to try and BINGO she ate almost the whole bag at one sitting! She never eats that many cookies at a time...I tried them and of course I finished off the bag.

"summarize: I have 2 wonderful felines that I consider my babies....but the hairball throw-up was everywhere, they weren't feeling good when it was preparing to come up and it was getting expensive to clean up!!  I've only had this product for about a month and already I'm seeing A LOT of improvement!!!  I'm soooo happy for them and for me!!!  First, my girl kitty is super picky and my guy kitty will eat just about anything but the consistency of this product took them both for a loop.  They wouldn't lick it off my finger or in a bowl with treats or put on their paws either.  So, I tried putting it in their wetfood (they get part of a can for one meal per day for many other reasons but mainly bc of my picky eater kitty).  I lay the wetfood in a layer in their bowl, squeeze the laxatone in the center & fold the outer edges of the wetfood over the center filled laxatone.  They also preferred the regular malt flavor to the tuna one which is interesting bc they prefer all their wetfood to be seafood flavors.  You just have to try different ones and se what your cats will prefer, I guess.  It took them about a week to get used to it but I stuck with it and now they eat it no problem.  I had my concerns that it wouldn't work as well being given with their wetfood but as I said...I've already seen a HUGE difference...where I had to clean up the hairball throw-up normally up to several times a week...now, within the month or so that I've been giving it to them, I've only had to clean it up twice in one whole month!!  I know it'll get even better as I continue to give it to them.  Not only that but they are eating better and I can tell they feel better bc their bathroom movements are much healthier looking (hey, only a mom can say this without cringing and be sincerely happy about this, right?!) and they are moving around with a lighter bounce in their step bc they aren't throwing up as much any more either.

"summarize: The second you open the bag, you can tell these dog treats are quality. There's actually an aroma to them -- not like a delicious gourmet aroma, but still, they smell like actual baked food instead of smelling like pressed carboard / sawdust, which is sorta what I think when I smell cheapo dog treats.<br /><br />My small dog (Cavalier King Charles) loves these treats, but the problem is, they're almost too hard for him to eat. He has the small teeth and 'soft mouth' characteristic of his breed and has trouble crunching these up. It's actually a good thing, because it forces him to 'savor' the treats (AKA they last longer), but it's something to consider if your dog is old/missing teeth.<br /><br />Other than that, these treats are great.

"summarize: Our family has decided that it would be wise to store a year's supply of food as a hedge against inflation as well as preparation for food supply disruptions due to natural or man-made disasters. Rather than just toss a bunch of mysterious items in the basement that would get thrown away in 20-30 years, I've been buying bulk grains from my local natural food store and cooking with powdered milk and eggs and such.<br /><br />This is my preferred brand of brown sugar. Fair trade is great, and the taste is very rich. I often settle for the store brand at the major, nation-wide natural food chain store when I shop locally. I only purchase this brand on sale as it costs about 15% more and I use a lot in my baking and cooking, plus we're buying ahead for our food storage. The price here on Amazon, using Subscribe & Save, will make this produce equal in price to the store brand, so I'm going for it.<br /><br />I have also had fewer issues with this brand (over the store brand) being hardened in its packaging. That makes me think this is a thicker, sturdier plastic less prone to tiny air holes, though I can't prove this suspicion.<br /><br />You can certainly buy cheaper brown sugar. I will continue researching local options for larger sizes in organics, but, in the case of this particular product (brown sugar), my cooking experience makes me willing to pay extra for this brand.",Quality is great; Amazon price is typical

"summarize: I love coffee. In the K-Cup world I'm not brand loyal. I used to frequent Gloria Jean's while growing up in So.Cal and like their icy sweet drinks before Coffee Bean or Starbucks had a comparable offering. Fast forward to today. In my honest opinion, this K-Cup tastes like dirty coffee warmed over. I wasn't expecting a cappuccino. I know what a Cappuccino is. I've been to France & Italy half a dozen times and fully enjoy espresso drinks while dining there. That said, what I was expecting was something that tasked vaguely like espresso perhaps or a full bodied roast.

"summarize: I am a big fan of hearty oatmeal.  I use Quaker oats for baking, but for a winter's breakfast, I want substance and flavor.  I've been eating and loving McCann's Irish Oatmeal for years.  I have tried and liked, but not loved, other steel-cut oats such as those from Bob's Red Mill, but I wondered if McCann's was the best, so I added this to an order I was already making.  I'm glad I didn't pay extra shipping for it.  This was disappointing.  The oatmeal is blander in flavor and mushier in texture than steel-cut oats.  If you like a softer, more traditional oatmeal, you might like it.  The packaging is frustrating, with the liquid-to-oat ratio given in volume of water to weight of oats rather than a dry measure.  This product is labeled for the U.K. market in which every kitchen has a scale, apparently, so you are on your own to figure out the best water-oats ratio.  It cooks quickly, so it may be similar to McCann's quicker-cooking oats (in the box; I've never tried those).  This bag is not resealable, so you will need a separate container or self-sealing bag to store it.  Several months later, most of my package is in my freezer and I'll probably end up tossing it.  If you are interested, this package weighs 1 kg and here is a price comparison:  Alford Organic Pinhead Oatmeal $7.99/35.27 oz. = $0.227 per oz.  vs. McCann's Irish Oatmeal (in package of 4 handy cans) $25.07/112 oz. = $0.223/oz + free shipping.",OK; not as good as McCann's
"summarize: We all remember the Saturday Night Live bit - ""With a name like Sumcker's, it has to be good..."" But in reality, they really do make wonderful products. My wife is really partial to cherry jellies and jams so when I saw their ""Orchard's Finest"" Michigan red Tart Cherry Preserves, I decided to be a home hero and surprise her with a jar. I didn't make a big deal about it. I just presented her with a Thomas's English Muffin (my favorite - even better - for me - than the much praised wolferman's english muffins) with the cherry preserves lovingly applied. Just like Igor in Young Frankenstein, she made yummy noises. She loved it and I was number one on the hit parade.<br /><br />She (we, actually) finished the jar quite quickly and this morning, we dipped into a Cherry Jelly from another famous and well regarded brand. No comparison - the Smucker's just flat blew the other brand away.<br /><br />Like cherries? Like Jelly? Want to have a breakfast party on your toast? Try this wonderful product.","One of the best ""jams"" I have ever tasted"
"summarize: The most important thing (to me at least) is that the color of this gold is great.  It may look greenish in the bottle, but on icing or fondant it has a nice warm color, not too yellow, not brassy, just really nice.<br /><br />I also like the different effects you can get through layering.  One coat produces a pearly gold shimmer, sort of like an Art Noveau enameled brooch. 2 + coats will get you a bolder solid gold look.  It's not going to come out like polished metal, but the effect is still VERY pretty and impressive.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this paint for writing or drawing on icing or fondant (you have to stroke over it repeatedly to produce crisp lines), but it's GREAT for ""highlighting"" raised areas and adding a beautiful something extra.","Lovely color, great to work with"
"summarize: What the hell was I thinking? Open can ..it smells foul ..no coffee smell at all ..just foul unrecognizable smell. Next morning opened container.. Still no coffee smell.. vague  fruit smell like that I have smelled in some tobacco's.. Over riding crap smell sends to have dissipated.. Noticed another reviewer mentioned a 'green' quality.. ie picked too early.. I would concur.<br /><br />I had purchased to mix with my premium blend for economy.. dumb dumb dumb lol decided to prepare as per my normal, unmixed. Whole milk to the boil, frappe, auto drip 6 teaspoons espresso grounds to 24 ounces of water. milk frappe in cup, ghost dust with cinnamin, med-light sprinkling of dark brown sugar on foam filled cup, pour 2-3 ounces if expresso straight down the middle.. As I do with premium blend.. Smellless, wow, after cooled to drinkable it's actually drinkable.. Though my stomach tells me the acid content after 3 sips is way to high.. And no coffee aroma our premium taste.. A slight green fruitiness..but not really a coffee taste.. definitely a do not buy brand. Too bad. It sucks",Prebrew smells crap post brew tastes crap
"summarize: I am a Cravings Place fan, and this is my favorite of all their mixes.  I have allergies/severe intolerances to wheat, dairy, eggs, and nuts.  It is hard to find tasty baked goods with a decent texture, but the Cravings Place mixes are the best at achieving both.<br /><br />I love this mix so much, that I had my mom make it for my wedding cake!  She used homemade, thick apple butter between the layers, and a maple frosting.  It was to die for!!!  Nobody could tell it was not ""normal"" cake, and nobody cared!  Like most GF cakes, this does not hold up so well to layering - but my mom is a kitchen goddess and figured it out.<br /><br />I make this mix frequently.  I love the cookies and cake equally.  I can't keep my husband out of it, either!<br /><br />Very fast and easy to make.  Serve a warm bar cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice/soy/rice cream for an excellent treat!",My favorite of all the Cravings Place mixes
"summarize: I usually buy the 10-gram, see my review of the coffee quality there. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LQTGNE"">Baronet Coffee Nutty Irishman Medium Roast, 18-Count Coffee Pods (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />This time I tried the 12-gram 16 per box. Same excellent coffee. Brewed the same way with a Cuisinart Cup-O-Matic, the larger size made very little difference. Additionally, so far 2 of the pods were split a little, spilling some of the coffee out. I can't be sure it didn't happen from tearing open the packet; perhaps you need to be more careful opening the larger pod packets.<br /><br />Bottom line for me: The difference between the 12-gram and the 10-gram wasn't significant. And the Baronet pods that are loose in bags contain only 7.77 grams per pod. So I will stick with the 10-gram 18-count.",12-gram Monster Pod Not Significantly Better
"summarize: This particular AKC treat is made in China.  Shame on you AKC.  I can not believe American Kennel Club is getting treats for our dogs and it is made in China !  I have lost all respect for AKC over this.  And, customers NEED to know many deaths of dogs have been linked again to China dog treats and this particular treat.  Don't take my word ... look it up.  Also look up vet Dr. Karen Becker.  She is keeping up with the research on this product too.  I hope Amazon will remove these treats and stop sending emails to customers to buy them.",AKC should stop selling this item.
